The South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) has condemned violence that broke out during voter registrations across the country and the torching of two houses in Masakona village outside Vuwani in Limpopo on Sunday.SANCO spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said violence during voter registration infringes the rights of eligible voters and cannot be condoned.He said denying people their right to vote is a myopic strategy that in the long run impacts on service delivery and community development.&#8220;The election campaign phase is a mandating period and not one during which grievances are resolved,&#8221; SANCO National Spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said.&#8220;Violent protests during voter registration and on election days denies eligible voters the right to exercise their constitutional right to vote for parties and or candidates of their own choice,&#8221; Mahlangu said.Mahlangu said that such actions are a violation of the electoral law which should be enforced with serious repercussions for those responsible for senseless violence and lawlessness.He has appealed to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Desmond Van Rooyen to take the disruptions into account before issuing a proclamation that will close the voters rolls.&#8220;The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) should be given space to devise a focused strategy to reach out to eligible voters who were affected before they are closed out,&#8221; Mahlangu said.Vuwani residents outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo on Friday said they would disrupt Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) voter registrations over the weekend because they were against the Demarcation Board s decision to amalgamate Vuwani and Malamulele area to form a new municipality.Demarcation Board Task Team (Community driven) spokesperson Arnold Mulaudzi said it is not only the Demarcation Task team but the whole community of Vuwani that includes traditional leaders saying we cannot be part of the new municipality.&#8220;We have been saying that even during the first voters registration weekend we said the same thing to them that we don t have a problem as long we are not going to vote with this new 345 entity number,&#8221; he said.Angry residents of Vuwani first embarked on a violent protest last month, blocking the first IEC voter registration process ahead of the municipal elections.-Nontokozo Gxumisa with Additional reporting: Hitekani Maimela&nbsp;
