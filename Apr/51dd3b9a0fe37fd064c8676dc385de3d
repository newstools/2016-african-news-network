Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials were under heavy police guard in Vuwani on Saturday during the final voter&#8217;s registration weekend.This comes after Vuwani residents outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo vowed to disrupt (IEC) voter registration.Members of the community met on Thursday night to discuss plans to disrupt IEC operations ahead of the voter registration this weekend.Angry residents of Vuwani last month embarked on a violent protest, blocking the first IEC voter registration process ahead of the municipal elections. Community members were upset by the Demarcation Board s decision to amalgamate Vuwani and Malamulele area to form a new municipality. Remember people from Vuwani have been saying that they are unwilling to be part of the new municipality. If you can access the IEC database you will find that people like me are registered under Malamulele Municipality which is wrong, Pro-Makhado Demarcation Board Task Team (Community driven) spokesperson Arnold Mulaudzi told The New Age.Mulaudzi said community members would have proceeded with the voter registration peacefully, if the government had let them retain their old entity number which is registered under Makhado Municipality. It is not only the Demarcation Task team but the whole community of Vuwani that includes traditional leaders saying we cannot be part of the new municipality. We have been saying that even during the first voters registration weekend we said the same thing to them that we don t have a problem as long we are not going to vote with this new 345 entity number, Mulaudzi said.Last month, Vuwani residents never pitched to register to vote at the Vuwani Municipality buildings.Roads were blocked with huge rocks and trees to prevent IEC officials from entering the area to conduct municipal voters registration.Some residents stated that they were happy that IEC officials left the area because they didn t want to vote. We are very happy because it was our expectation for the IEC not to operate in our community. We are very excited that they failed to operate here, one resident said.-ANN7 Reporter
