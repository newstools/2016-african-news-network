Batandwa MalingoThe three mineworkers trapped underground at Lily Mine in Mpumalanga are probably dead by now.This was revealed by the mine yesterday as the three have been trapped in a steel container underground for more than two months without water and food.The mine said the three workers, Solomon Nyarende, Pretty Nkambule and Yvonne Mnis, were working in a container on the surface when the mine collapsed and their container sunk in a hole on February 5.Yesterday the mine spokesperson, Coetzee Zietsman, said it was clear now that the three were not alive. I think its clear at this point we can no longer call it a rescue operation, unfortunately, he said.Meanwhile, trade union Solidarity said the collapse of Lily Mine in Mpumalanga might have been fatal from the outset and rumours that knocking sounds were heard from the three miners trapped in the container were incorrect. Our information is that the workers were working out of a temporary building. I believe it is out of respect for the three families of the missing employees that they were not declared dead.It might also be due to cultural sensitivities and we acknowledge that it is the prerogative of the families, Department of Mineral Resources and mine management to decide on the appropriate way of dealing with the status of the missing workers, Solidarity general-secretary Gideon du Plessis said.The mine had earlier said it could detect knocking sounds from where the container was located but Du Plessis refuted this.He said the mine was drawing up plans and getting teams ready to drill a new portal which would lead them to the three miners.The Department of Mineral Resources spokesperson was unavailable for comment yesterday.batandwam@thenewage.co.za
