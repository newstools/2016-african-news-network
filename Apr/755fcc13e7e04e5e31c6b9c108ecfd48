TNA reporter Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has been admitted to hospital. Media reports said yesterday
that the she had been in ill for quite a while. There was no indication as to what she was suffering from, but she had been in and
out of hospital in recent years with diabetes. Her friends said she fell ill after the Mthatha High Court dismissed her claim to her former
husband’s home in Qunu. Her lawyer Mvuso Notyesi said they would appeal the judgment. Sources said her diabetic
condition was preventing doctors from performing the surgery she requires. news@thenewage.co.za
