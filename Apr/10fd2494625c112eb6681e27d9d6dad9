THE Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope will enable African scientists to show the world that the continent can host one of the world s largest science research projects.Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor was speaking at the third annual ministerial meeting of the nine SKA African partner countries.The meeting enabled ministers and delegates to update each other on the SKA s progress. Once complete, the SKA will use 1 000 giant satellite dishes to zoom into space.The aim is to discover some of science s unanswered questions, such as what could have happened before creation and if there is life out there.SKA project director Rob Adams said: When the full SKA is built on the African continent and in Australia, the amount of data flowing in that instrument will be the same as the amount of data in the entire internet. South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia will jointly host Africa s contribution to the SKA.Pandor signed a memorandum of understanding with representatives of the partner countries. We undertook, as partners, that we will show the world Africa can handle a large research infrastructure project. From the reports I m receiving and the commitment you are showing, I m convinced that we can do it and we will show the world that excellence will come from the African continent, she said.Delegates believe the project will enable for the partner countries to position themselves in the new technological world.Ghana will implement a SKA communications strategy to educate people about the benefits of this project.Leela Devi Dookun-Luchoomun, Mauritius minister of education and human resources, tertiary education and scientific research, said the project has helped them improve their astronomy training and infrastructure development.She believes that the country will also benefit from the information that this infrastructure will generate for healthcare needs, agriculture and social development programmes As far as Mauritius is concerned, we have been preparing ourselves for the readiness of the SKA project.We have to come up with new infrastructure but as far as human capital development is concerned, we are going fast. Ten years ago, the University of Mauritius started training PhD students in the fields of astronomy and technology, she said.Since the beginning of the project, about 820 students have been funded and 140 of those students come from the African partner countries.Botswana Science and Technology Minister Nonofo Molefhi said the SKA will not only benefit scientists but will also help to address some of the socio-economic challenges facing the region. Being in close proximity with South Africa, we became a good neighbour by extending our support. Though it might be considered more to do with astronomy, the information we get from the analysis of the atmosphere could help those in the areas of climate change, Molefhi said.Twenty one of the 64 Meerkat test dishes for the SKA are expected to be operating by June. Once completed, the SKA will have 3000 dishes.Of these, 70% will be in South Africa. The others will be shared with Australia and the continent s partner countries.-TNA Reporternews@thenewage.co.za
