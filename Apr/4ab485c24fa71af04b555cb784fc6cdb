Workers at Optimum Mine in Mpumalanga on Friday pleaded with Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane to continue engaging with the banks amid fears of job losses.The workers spoke to Minister Zwane during his site visit at Optimum Mine as part of his continuous engagement with stakeholders in the mining sector.The workers told Minister Zwane that it is pivotal that he and other ministers (Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant) appointed by Cabinet to engage with the country&#8217;s top banks namely First National Bank (FNB), Absa, Nedbank and Standard Bank following the banks closing the Oakbay Investments accounts. Minister please continue to talk to the banks, it is stressful when one thinks about the possibility of not getting a salary at the end of the month because we have families to fend for, now imagine what will happen when we don&#8217;t get paid or loose or jobs, said an aggrieved Oakbay worker.Responding to the workers, Minister Zwane openly told the workers that some of the banks had declined to meet with him and other two ministers but was also quick to assure the miners not to lose hope as they will find every way possible to engage with the workers. We approached some of them and they declined to meet with us last week. We are not going to take it in a democratic country, we will lobby institutions that will service people and work with them, Minister Zwane said.Workers also told Minister Zwane that this site visit should not be the last but be the first of many more visit to come as his presence gives the workers hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.Minister Zwane also thanked the workers for participating in the peaceful march on Tuesday and said that if the banks cared about their clients they will be quick in their response to the workers. We applaud you peacefully marching to the banks, if they care for their people they will respond. If they don&#8217;t, we will take steps and speak to the Cabinet and President, said Minister Zwane.&nbsp;
