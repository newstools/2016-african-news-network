Most of the employees at the opposition coalition-led Thabazimbi municipality are still sitting on plastic chairs while the municipal bosses are engaged in talks with lawyers to get back chairs and computers attached by the sheriff of the court two weeks ago.The new council, led by Thabazimbi Residents Association and backed by the DA, EFF and FFplus, was greeted into office by the sight of trucks being loaded with furniture and computers belonging to the municipality following a court order by service providers last month. Affected workers are just devising means. The sheriff did not attach the plastic chairs and some workers are using them now, municipality spokesperson Joshua Motsomane said yesterday.The municipality, which has been under administration since last year, suffered the loss of the furniture after service providers took legal action to get the money owed to them.The companies said the municipality had failed several times to pay for services and goods supplied. The municipality administrator, advocate Letjepe Thubakgale, told The New Age yesterday he was optimistic the attached goods would be returned. We are in discussion with legal representatives of service providers and have already paid more than R170 000 to affected companies. This resulted in the waste truck not been taken and talks are ongoing with affected companies to hand back computers and furniture, Thubakgale said.But some services at the embattled municipality snatched from the ANC by the opposition coalition in the aftermath of the August 3 municipal elections, are still in operation.Some officials still have laptops while the revenue office was not affected by the sheriff s actions. Our three satellite offices are unaffected and still operating normally, Motsomane said.-Montsho Matlala
