The road safety authorities in the province have expressed sadness at the loss of lives on busy roads around the province at the weekend.Traffic officers worked around the clock until yesterday morning to monitor high traffic volumes caused largely by ZCC members returning home after their annual end of calendar year pilgrimage in Moria City church headquarters outside Polokwane. At Haakdoring between Mokopane and Mookgopong, a Toyota Quantum overturned, killing a man on Sunday night at 8.15pm. Fourteen people sustained injuries and were taken to the nearby hospital. The minibus apparently experienced a burst tyre before losing control and crashing, provincial transport safety security and liaison department spokesperson Kagiso Mootane said yesterday.In another crash, five people were injured following a collision between a minibus and a bakkie on the N1 between Condrington offramp near Bela-Bela on Saturday. Both vehicles caught fire in the collision but no fatalities were reported, Mootane said.Fifteen people were reported dead in various road accidents around the province at the weekend. The fatalities included pedestrians, drivers, passengers and cyclists. The number is set to increase as reports are still coming in from various regions, Mootane said. The statistics compiled during the same period last year show that 10 people lost their lives in 34 road crashes in the province.Roads in the province usually experience high traffic volumes during the ZCC and St Engenas pilgrimages in September and the Easter season. The normal festive travels during December and early January also keep traffic officers hands full.-Montsho Matlala
