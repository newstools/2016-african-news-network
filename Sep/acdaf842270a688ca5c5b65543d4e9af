The community of Barseba near Rustenburg have barricaded roads since the early hours of Thursday morning due to lack of water for the past three weeks.Community members said they have been without water and the municipality has not addressed the matter. Residents allege that before the Local government elections they had water but after the elections they started to experience water shortages.Protesters barricaded the N4 road leading to Sun City resort in the North West with burning tyres.The executive mayor of Rustenburg Mpho Khunou was expected to addressed the community on Thursday morning but was a no-show for the meeting.However the municipality sent the MMC for infrastrcture Shadrack Wolmarans to address the community.Wolmarans said they are trying by all means to assist the community by sending out a technical team to solve the problem.&#8220;The reason for the water shortages is that the reservoirs are not full to capacity and residents are subjected to restrictions at certain hours,&#8221; he said.The residents said these restrictions were not properly communicated to them.Protestors have vowed to continue protesting until they are addressed by the Mayor.Meanwhile in another incident in eMalahleni in Mpumalanga, the Select Committee on Social Services at eMalahleni municipality is concerned about media reports regarding the latest protests over dirty water.The committee said: &#8220;The provision of quality clean water is a human right and the municipality must work towards providing this service.&#8221;The current protests fly in the face of the 2013 South African Human Rights Commission s report that found that the municipality violated the right to clean drinking water.The Chairperson of the Committee Cathy Dlamini said: this means that the municipality has either ignored the recommendations of the commission or implementation has not filtered through to the people on the ground. This needs urgent attention from the municipality.&#8221;&#8220;While the Committee is concerned about these protests, it is aware that the challenges the municipality faces are symptomatic of the challenges faced nationally,&#8221; said Dlamini.The committee added that the issue of infrastructure maintenance and the lack of adequate skills to sustain water provision, water use trends as well as the payment of services by municipalities to water boards, continue to pose a major challenge to provision of quality water to the people.The Committee urged the Department of Cooperative Governance, the South African Local Government Association and municipalities to work collaboratively with the aim of finding lasting solutions to these challenges.TNA Reporter
