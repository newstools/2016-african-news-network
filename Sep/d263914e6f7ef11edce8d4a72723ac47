SUICIDE among police officers has declined in recent years, according to a policing expert. This is part of a doctoral thesis by criminologist and policing expert Grainne Perkins who has done extensive research into police suicides. At least two police officers have committed suicide in recent weeks in Cape Town, while in Pretoria the Independent Police Investigation Directorate is investigating the murder of two women by an officer who later took his own life. Perkins said that in 2012-13, a total of 84 police officers were murdered on and off duty and 116 committed suicide. The figure has since declined. “From 2014 to 2015, there were 86 police officers murdered and 53 committed suicide,” Perkins said. She said officers were receiving assistance. “Addressing the situation, the suicide numbers and the employee wellness programmes they have in place, certainly did improve the numbers of a downward trend,” she said. Perkins said her research showed that officers had begun to feel more comfortable talking to counsellors about mental health issues. Meanwhile, two policemen appeared in the Somerset West Magistrate’s Court yesterday after they were apprehended during separate raids last week on charges of corruption. Another officer appeared in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court last Friday. One officer, who worked at Parow police station, was arrested at his home last Wednesday on charges of corruption, dealing in drugs and for the possession of stolen property. The constable was released on R5000 bail in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on Friday. He will be back in court next week. A second officer was taken into custody after being arrested at his home in Strand last Thursday. The officers were apprehended following an extensive two-year long investigation. In addition, another officer was arrested the following day, with more arrests expected. provinces@thenewage.co.za
