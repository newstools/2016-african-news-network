The school trial examinations in Vuwani, which started a week behind schedule, are still on track. Pupils in the area spent three months at home while schools were closed and some torched during community protests against the municipal border demarcation decisions, demanding the reversal of the incorporation of Vuwani into a new municipality in Malamulele.Trial examinations started on September 1. We are happy that pupils in Vuwani are writing trial examinations without hindrance thus far. We are optimistic they will be on track until the end of examinations on September 19, provincial education department spokespersonDr Naledzani Rasila said. Most pupils in the area are attending classes in mobile classrooms and under trees. During the protests, which started on May 1, all schools were shut down and only reopened in the middle of last month after a peace deal was brokered between the government and traditional leaders to revise the reincorporation of the area into Makhado municipality in Louis Trichardt.The government has appealed to donors, institutions and individuals to help with cash donations or give their time to rebuild about 30 schools damaged during the violent protests.Global child advocacy and humanitarian organisation World Vision SA has urged civil society NGOs and corporate bodies to also help with resources to rebuild the schools in the area. We are appealing to communities to assist in the repair of salvageable classrooms and other facilities. These facilities can be used in the interim while the schools are rebuilt, World Vision SA advocacy team leader Ernest Fraser said.Provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba said the total amount required for emergency reconstruction and rehabilitation of educational infrastructure in Vuwani amounts to R303m.-Montsho Matlala
