Basic Education (@DBE_SA) September 2, 2016&#8220;The objective of ASIDI is to eradicate the Basic Safety Norms backlog in schools without water, sanitation and electricity and to replace those schools constructed from inappropriate material (mud, plankie, asbestos) to contribute towards levels of optimum learning and teaching,&#8221; the Department said.Since inception in 2011, the ASIDI programme has built and delivered 170 state of the art schools across the country, a large portion of which are in the Eastern Cape. Over and above this, the initiative has provided water to 596 schools, sanitation to 414 schools and electricity to 307 schools that previously had no access to these basic amenities.#ASIDI Over and above newly completed schools, a further 418 schools now have decent sanitation pic.twitter.com/mprbozQbpB&mdash; Dep.

Basic Education (@DBE_SA) September 1, 2016In February 2016 Depty Minister Enver Surty offically handed opened Parkview Primary School in Atlantis Cape Town which was one of the schools to benefit from the ASIDI programme.The R8.2-billion ASIDI programme focuses on eradication of schools built from inappropriate material and to provide basic services of water, sanitation and electricity.&#8220;Routine maintenance of school facilities in our country is generally not at an acceptable level, resulting in further deterioration over time. The neglect exposes learners to danger and cost the state more over time as the conditions of buildings deteriorate and have to be replaced.To this effect, the sector is strengthening the maintenance of schools by ring fencing funds for the sole use of maintaining education facilities across the country and address the culture of neglecting the maintenance of our schools,&#8221; Department of Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said in July.TNA Reporter
