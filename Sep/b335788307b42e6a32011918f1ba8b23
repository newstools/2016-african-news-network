In particular, the science lab will ensure that learners are exposed to basic science equipment in an environment that is conducive to learning, said Nduvane.Principal of Castle Bridge Combined School Raletebele G Daniels said that the school is grateful to Engen for the support. The biggest impact for us will be the reaction from our teachers and students when they see their new facilities. They will be proud of the new environment in which students can thrive and learn, said Daniels. This very generous donation will further enhance the school to realise its vision and that of the National Development Plan 2025.
