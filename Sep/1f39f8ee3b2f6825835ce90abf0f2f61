THERE has been a slight decrease in the water levels of the four dams that supply Mangaung and Bloemfontein with water, says a statement released by the Department of Water and Sanitation.According to the statement, this week the dams stood at 37.3% capacity compared with 37.7% last week, a decrease of 0.4% while the system was at 32.2% at the same time last year We continue to monitor 211 dams on a weekly basis. Twelve dams are now below 10%, 61 are below 40% and 20 dams are above 100%, departmental spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said. Our national storage is under increasing stress and still shows a steady decline week on week. He said water users need to continue to intensify the enforcement of restrictions to stretch the available water supplies in the country. The drought is far from over and even with a normal season it will take a number of years for the system to stabilise, Ratau said.Given the present condition of the veld cover (vegetation), we can expect increased levels of runoff even with a weak La Ni a. The expected La Ni a is very weak and trending towards neutral. Most key atmospheric variables continue to indicate neutral ENSO conditions. It further warned the country of below normal rainfall and warm temperatures during spring. The South African Weather Service also said there would be very bleak weather prospects this week as a series of cold fronts would travel across parts of the country, which will bring about a cold Sunday and some snowfalls over the south eastern parts of SouthAfrica, that will be followed by some showers.TSHIMOLOGO LEEUW
