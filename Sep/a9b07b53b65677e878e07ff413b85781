Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza had on Monday urged all municipal leadership in the province to continue to work hard and win people&#8217;s trust.Mabuza was addressing Provincial Executives and Councillors at the premier s coordinating forum lekgotla that was held in white river.Premier told the executives that the message from the people to the governing party was clear and that people were losing confidence in the African National Congress (ANC).He further told members of the provincial government that the opposition parties were taking an advantage of the party s vulnerability, although Mabuza admitted some of the unfortunates the ANC had experience, he also said some of the things were exaggerated by the opposition. Judging from the results of the local government elections, we have seen that there is some discontent from our people, some opted to abstain from voting. I am however sure that some of our people still have hope on us that we will attend to their issues, the premier said.Mabuza went on to caution his colleagues about being in a hurry lead at all costs. He said people who were in a hurry to assume leadership position delivered disastrous results. Leaders will come and leaders will go, we need to be patient enough to observe these times. Let us bear in mind that we are source of the most of the problems we have, they emanate from us. Our span of life as politicians is very short, however we go to that space knowing very well our jobs are not guaranteed, Mabuza added.He then took a swipe at executive mayors for their lack of accountability and not taking responsibility as political heads in their respectful municipalities, saying that municipalities finances were in mess.The premier also warned mayors not to hire new staff if the municipality doesn t have enough budget and also avoid spending what they did not have. All of us here are owing Eskom, we are paying penalties year-in-year out. At one stage I once proposed that municipalities should pull out of this account because they are operating at a loss, he said.He however said as government they can still turn things around if as servant of the people focus at their objective of providing a good quality leadership and in turn create much needed jobs. We have realized that as the ruling party, our downfall is at the municipal level, we must strengthen ourselves at this sphere because we are aware also that opposition parties are using this card of lack of employment because people expect government to create jobs and employ everyone, Mabuza reiterated.-Sipho Jack
