The government and Droogfontein Solar Power team up to bring reading coach initiative to schools in provinceTHE Northern Cape department of education has initiated a programme called Reading Coach as an intervention to generate a love for reading among primary school children. The programme is funded by Droogfontein Solar Power.Director of the curriculum Basie Mathane said pupils at the end of the foundation phase had only a rudimentary grasp of the principles of reading and writing, which made it very hard for them to overcome obstacles in later years, particularly in mathematics and science.Evidence suggests that a large number of South African pupils had learning deficits apparent already in the lower grades and that this was the root cause of underperformance in later years.He said the root of these difficulties points to pupils not mastering the elementary numeracy and literacy skills in the foundation and intermediate phases, leading to them being precluded from further learning and engaging fully with the grade-appropriate curriculum.The programme aims to intervene with the low levels of reading through the assistance of out-of-school youth in selected foundation and intermediate schools. Mathane said the department remained committed to working in partnership with Droogfontein Solar Power to improve the reading abilities of pupils and enhance their opportunities to have a better chance of succeeding in life.Droogfontein plant manager Mpho Makhetha said they were pleased to welcome representatives from the department together with a group of reading coaches as part of their economic development programme and their partnership with education.It is believed that the programme has already been successfully implemented in all the primary schools in Riverton, Ritchie and Barkley West and has been running smoothly for the last two years. The focus is to improve literacy and numeracy levels of grades 1 to 3 pupils by providing scheduled reading sessions in Xhosa and Afrikaans vernacular, he said.The programme incorporates a number of elements, such as employment opportunities, training and resources. Makhetha said the department was encouraged by the role that Droogfontein Solar Power continued to play in working with the department to provide quality education to the most needy. The influence and impact of this partnership can only lay a strong foundation for improved outcomes in the participating schools, Makhetha said.Droogfontein Solar Power has provided jobs for 10 previously unemployed matriculants from the area who now receive a stipend each month and are being provided with work experience to improve their opportunities or to study further.These coaches run reading sessions with groups of up to 15 children at a time, although most of these groups are smaller so that each child gets individual attention.The project is funded over a threeyear period and performance will be measured by the improvement of the annual national assessment tests. It is reported that each participating school will get book grants over the three-year period.-SMANGA KUMALO
