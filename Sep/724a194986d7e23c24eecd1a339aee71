Culture, arts and traditional affairs MEC Ontlametse Mochware, launched this year s provincial leg of the seventh National Book Week at the Rebecca Nkae Thulo community library in Khuma, Klerksdorp, on Wednesday.The book week campaign will run until Sunday.The campaign seeks to encourage a culture of reading and the importance of books in society.In her address to people who gathered at the launch, Mochware said South Africans had to work hard to promote a culture of reading.She said a 2014 world culture score index in reading revealed that people in India read at least 10 hours and 45 minutes a week, whereas South Africans read for only six hours and 15 minutes in the same period.This brought South Africa to the world ranking of 15th.Mochware said: I wish to challenge each person here today to help change this ranking. Let us from today onwards strive to become a reading nation, which is a winning nation. The department encourages community libraries to establish book clubs where people from different age groups and people with different interests meet on a regular basis to read. There are success stories in the library services of the city of Matlosana. It has been reported that there is an achievers book club at the main library in Klerksdorp that meets monthly in the library hall, she said.In Stilfontein two book clubs have been established, the Reading Dynamites and the Bookworm Story Club for Grade R pupils.Basetsana Letsie Book Club has been established in Rebecca Nkae Thulo Library, while A re tsweleleng Service Club caters for the elderly in Jouberton township.Since 2007, the department has been organising festivals for Setswana books and reading, which is a campaign aimed at promoting the reading of indigenous language books in community libraries.Mochware used the opportunity to welcome winners of the 2015-16 competition that ran throughout selected community libraries across the four districts of the province.She said the 2016-17 edition of the competition was continuing in the community libraries of Tlokwe, Mahikeng, Rustenburg and Kagisano Molopo local municipalities, encouraging members of the community to participate.One of the key strategies of the department is the establishment of a publishing house in order to encourage the publishing of indigenous African languages.The department officially launched the Bokone Bophirima publishing house in October 2015.ELFAS TORERAI
