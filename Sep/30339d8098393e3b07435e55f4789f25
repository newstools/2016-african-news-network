THE fourth annual memorial lecture for the slain former University of Limpopo SRC president,Onkgopose Tiro, will take place at the university hall named after him outside Polokwane today.Tiro was murdered through a letter bomb while in exile in Botswana by apartheid agents in 1974.He was expelled from the university following a speech he made during the 1972 graduation ceremony in which he sharply criticised the Bantu education system and decried the second class or zero status given to the role and contribution of black parents.Even after leaving the university in the middle of his humanities studies, the apartheid forces continued to harass him until he went to exile in Botswana where he was assassinated.The memorial lecture in his honour will be addressed by fellow student activist who is now a respectable author and academic, Prof Thomas K Ranuga.Ranuga is the author of the historic memoir, Surviving Apartheid and other books including The New South Africa and the Socialist Vision and South Africa under Majority Rule.Now 78 years old, Ranuga was studying pharmacy at then University of the North in 1972.He was also forced to leave his studies unfinished due to harassment by apartheid forces and went to England where he obtained a degree in sociology from Polytechnic in North London.In 1982 he completed his PhD in sociology from Brandeis University in the US.&#8211;MONTSHO MATLALA
