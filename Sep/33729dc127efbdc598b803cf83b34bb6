Academic activities at the University of Limpopo were suspended on Wednesday following violent student protests over free education.Classes were expected to resume at 7:30am but students reportedly did not pitch for any classes.SRC President Samuel Tladi said activities at the university will not resume while government ignores their demands. Protests at the university will still continue until our demands are met by the government. What we want is free education but not an increase on the fees, said Tladi.All students have been instructed by the university to vacate residences by 5pm Wednesday afternoon.I didn&#39;t see this coming since Mr @MohubaKgalema earlier said it would be business as usual. #ULShutdown pic.twitter.com/leblrVRsWF&mdash; Livhu Nemutanzhela (@L_Nemutanzhela) September 28, 2016Six students at Limpopo University s Mankweng campus were arrested for public violence on Tuesday after clashes broke out between private security personnel and protesters.Three of the students were released and others are due to appear in court on Thursday.Student protests flared up after an announcement by Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande that fee increase for 2017 would be capped at 8% which brought another wave of protests as students demand a no fee increase until government implements free higher education.-TNA Reporter
