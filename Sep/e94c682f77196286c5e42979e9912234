THE mayor of Phokwane municipality Maria Kalman has appointed committee members to administrate the affairs of her new council.The appointment of the council committee members comes after the ANC won the municipality during the local government elections last month.Stoffel Mokale was appointed as the new member of mayoral committee for finance, Anna Moremong will lead corporate services, Shadract Thube will head technical services, while Crocket Adams is responsible for community services.Municipality spokesperson Kgalalelo Letshabo said the new members were appointed and sworn in last week and they have already taken up their tasks to serve the community of Phokwane.During the inaugural meeting which elected the mayor, speaker and chief whip, Kalman said their key focus was to remain firmly on improving quality of life across all communities.Kalman said they would redouble their efforts to improve quality of life of residents and ensured that both management and staff were held accountable for the quality of service delivery. We will continue with the process to refurbish and replace our infrastructure network and ensure that all residents have access to quality water, reliable electricity and decent sanitation, Kalman said.Meanwhile during the first day of the ANC annual lekgotla provincial secretary Zamani Saul said it was important that the organisation went all out to reclaim the lost electoral support. Quality of leadership and consciousness, improved quality service delivery, improved performance are and key, Saul said.He further said the party needed to look into incompetence, self-serving and uncaring councillors which led to leaders distancing themselves from community members.The two day provincial lekgotla is set to reflect on the outcomes of the local government elections and map a way forward.Kalman also said that the municipality would roll out programmes which would widen the net of social packages in addressing child-headed households and people living with and affected by HIV-Aids.She issued a stern warning on corruption and wasteful expenditure which has a negative effect in rolling out service delivery. In the next few weeks the incoming portfolio committees will undertake a process of translating our commitments into concrete plans of actions, Kalman said.The Phokwane local municipality is named after Queen Phokwane the wife of Kgosi Galeshewe of Baralong boo Ra-Tlhaping tribe.
