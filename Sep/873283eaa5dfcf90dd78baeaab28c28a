THE Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has developed a new draft policy on climate change and another on sustainable hydropower generation.The department said that a consultative workshop would be held at the water affairs offices in Beaconsfield, Kimberley today. The department said the two policies had been gazetted and were open for public comments and inputs.Spokesperson Amogelamg Richard Moholoeng said the department was calling on members of the community to listen and make recommendations about hydropower and climate change strategies. DWS seeks to include the public by allowing them the opportunity to make verbal and written comments about the hydropower and climate change policies through the public consultations that are taking place across the country. Such engagements allow interested and affected parties and members of the public to form part of the solutionfinding processes on issues affecting them, Moholoeng said.He said the Cabinet-approved national climate change response white paper, which sets out the overall national government response to challenges of climate change, recognises water as one of a number of sectors that need immediate attention. It is against this background that the department has developed a sector specific policy position on climate change to address specifically water and sanitation-related climate change issues. Water and energy are interdependent where in one hand energy is required in the supply of water and water required in energy generation, Moholoeng said.He said individuals should add their voice/ideas to ensure effective adaptation by the sector to climate change and strengthened role of water in mitigation.-NOMUSA MVUBU
