The legendary rain queen, Modjadji of the Bolobedu dynasty outside Modjadjiskloof, will be officially recognised today. The courtesy call at the Khethakoni palace will be made by Cooperative
Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen, his deputy
Obed Bapela, Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha and mayors from five local
municipalities in the district. The Modjadji Queenship, recognised by African people for centuries, was
abolished by the apartheid regime in 1972.
Makoma Modjadji, who was on the throne at the time, was demoted to the
status of ordinary chief. Forty-four years later, her granddaughter Masalanabo, who is only 11
years old, has regained the queenship to become South Africa’s only recognised
female queen. Masalanabo will be groomed by her elders until she can officially ascend the
throne when she comes of age. Her mother Makobo Modjadji died in
2005 of natural causes. She was 27 years old. “The Queenship of Bolobedu was recognised in terms of Section 2A (3) (a)
of the Traditional Leadership Governance Framework Act, 2003 (Act No. 41
of 2003) on March 2016,” a statement issued by the cooperative governance
and traditional affairs department said. In the Balobedu tradition, it is only women who ascend the throne.
After holding talks with the regent MT Modjadji and his Bakgomana, the
minister and his entourage will meet indunas and community members at
Mokwakwaila village. -Montsho Matlala
