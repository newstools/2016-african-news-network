A Medical doctor arrested for the theft of anti Aids drugs including morphine
as well as fraud will be suspended by the provincial health department. Department spokesperson Derick Kganyago yesterday said the doctor would be placed on precautionary suspension on full salary pending an internal investigation. The accused, Adekunle Ganiyu Adefila, 44, appeared briefly in the Polokwane
Magistrate’s Court yesterday and was released on R5000 bail. The case
was postponed to September 2 for further investigation. He was arrested at Rethabile Clinic which is attached to Pietersburg Hospital
by the Hawks on Tuesday following a tip-off that he had allegedly been
selling prescription drugs for more than two years. “The doctor acquired morphine since 2015 using another doctor’s stamp,
forged signature and the letterhead of the provincial health department,”
Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke said. Police also searched Adefila’s house and allegedly found 35 bottles containing antiretroviral tablets (ARVs). A theft of ARVs scandal has hit the province twice in less than a month. On June 28, a nurse employed at Makgato Clinic in Botlokwa was arrested by an undercover Hawks agent while allegedly selling ARVs to members of the
public in the Polokwane CBD. Mokgadi Ramusi, 44, has since appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court
on charges of illegal possession of ARV drugs and released on R1000
bail. The case was postponed to August 18. According to the Hawks she was
found selling 24 sealed bottles containing ARV medication for R7 500.
The department has put her on precautionary suspension. Montsho Matlala
