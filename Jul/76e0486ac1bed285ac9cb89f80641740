All mayors elected under the ANC banner during the municipal elections next month will sign performance agreements and present plans to turn around their municipalities, ANC provincial secretary Nocks Seabi said.Seabi and his deputy Makoma Makhurupetje unveiled 10 of the party s 26 mayoral candidates at the Frans Mohlala House yesterday. It is in the context of the current situation in which none of the municipalities got clean audits, we are saying the new mayors must come up with turnaround strategies. They must develop localised strategies in order to create employment and entrepreneurship at the local level, Seabi said.He said the 10 municipalities were chosen to unveil the faces of potential mayors because of their strategic positions in the province.Among the mayoral candidates endorsed for a second term are Polokwane mayor Thembi Nkadimeng, Musina mayor Mihloti Muhlope, Lephalale mayor Jack Maeko and Mopani district mayor Nkakareng Rakgoale.Though not the incumbent now, Florence Radzilani, who has been chosen to lead Vhembe should the party retain power, would not be new in the position as she is a former mayor of the district.The new faces include Stan Ramaila (Sekhukhune district), John Mpe (Capricorn district), Morris Mataboge (Waterberg district), Maripe Mangena (Greater Tzaneen municipality) and Adrina Matsemela (Mogalakwena municipality). These mayoral candidates carry a clear mandate to provide decent housing, clean water, dignified sanitation and decent jobs to our people, Seabi said. He said the ANC was confident of sweeping all before them the municipalities at the polls next month.-Montsho Matlala
