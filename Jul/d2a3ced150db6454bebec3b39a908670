Three elderly people cried with joy when they received fully-furnished houses in celebration of Mandela Month. The residents of Mzinti near Tonga outside Malelane were presented with
the homes by the provincial department of human settlements in partnership
with its stakeholders, including local business people last week . Emma Mkhatshwa, 80, who has been living in a dilapidated one-room
shack for several years, is among the recipients. She said the new house was a blessing as she never believed she would one day
have such a house. “I am excited to be among the beneficiaries. I have been longing for a
moment like this for years. I thank God for answering my prayers by sending the
good Samaritans to rescue me from the housing challenge. “I want to thank the government and I hope even Mandela will be happy when
he sees his desire of taking care of the poor being fulfilled,” Mkhatshwa said. Ressa Nkomo, 72 and Elijah Sihlangu, 73, were the other beneficiaries.
Human settlements MEC Violet Siwela said the department and its
stakeholders would wrap up their campaign by rolling it out in the Msukaligwa
local municipality tomorrow. The municipality includes places like Ermelo and Wesselton. Siwela, who is also serving as the ANC provincial deputy chairperson, said the department would continue to
deliver better services to the people. “Madiba was selfless in his work and he stood for humanity.
“The department started this year’s celebration for Madiba Month in the
Emalahleni local municipality with a symbolic construction and painting of
houses at Extension 11 in KwaGuqa. “The department also partnered with the Emalahleni Housing Company by
donating 1000 blankets to needy households and welfare organisations,” Siwela
said. -France Nyaka
