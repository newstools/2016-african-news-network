Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane and mayoral candidate of Cape Town Patricia De Lille this week introduced the DA ward candidates Thanduxolo Wili and Soraya Rigby to the community of Kuyasa, Khayelitsha.The DA highlighted what it had done for the province, the city and for Ward 97. It said that the party would continue making progress in the city of Cape Town when elected on August 3.De Lille said: The DA built a library, the Mandela Sports Park, a clinic and many more facilities. But we also know that there are problems of unemployment and housing issues that we need to address. We want our people not to rely on handouts but to work for a living and we are creating jobs to alleviate that problem especially good job programmes for the youth. The ward candidates also addressed other issues including gangsterism, alcohol and drug abuse and pension grants.Maimane said the DA would continue making progress in the city of Cape Town when elected on August 3. We are the only party that is interested in the poor people of South Africa. As you can see in many places, the ANC is concerned with protecting the rich and those who are politically connected to the ANC and with President Jacob Zuma. We have to make sure there is clean governance. We have to deliver better services and ultimately you can see that the DA is growing in communities such as Khayelitsha because the country is at a point where we can say the DA is a party for all South Africans, Maimane said.He also addressed the issue of the DA s advert not being aired by the SABC as it was informed there were no available slots for political advertisements at the time due to delays in the IEC s work for the elections.-Tatenda Chiriseri
