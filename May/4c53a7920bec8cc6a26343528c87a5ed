Kurhuleni residents outside Louis Trichardt took to social media to express outrage after Monday night&#8217;s torching of a primary school.They were outraged, allegedly against neighbouring Venda-speaking residents whom they are accusing of being responsible for the attack.This after the Venda-speaking residents opposed the demarcation board&#8217;s decision to incorporate the Vuwani area and Malamulele to form a new municipality.Kurhuleni residents were among other communities who rejoiced on Friday when Judge Ephraim Makgoba said the applicants (traditional leaders and community leaders) failed to give sufficient reasons why the Municipal Demarcation Board&#8217;s decision should be reversed.The Kurhuleni residents were happy to join the new municipality to be formed in Malamulele.The neighbouring areas around Vuwani including Masia were bitter after the judgement in the Limpopo High Court on Friday.Influential business man and engineer Ndhuma Masingi expressed his anger and asked &#8220;why are regional leaders so quiet about the anarchy and acts of barbarism in Vuwani, if they don&#8217;t want to be perceived as part of the problem?&#8221;The vha-Venda king, Tony Mphemphu Ramabulani, executive mayor of Vhembe District Municipality, ANC regional chairperson councillor Tshitereke Matibe, Mayor of Makhado local municipality councillor David Mutavhatshimbi were among the leaders pin-pointed.Masingi added: I strongly suspect they firmly support this anarchic campaign to maintain their imaginary set-up of the old defunct republic of Venda homeland. Chris Mashimbye, a resident, told The New Age that he was disappointed by the &#8220;barbaric acts&#8221; of burning schools and government institutions. I am not saying go and burn buildings but burning a primary school at all things it is very wrong. I am disappointed on this because it is based on tribalism. I think some Vendas think they are superior to us Tsonga people,&#8221; he said.A well-known resident in the area Winners Tivani said it was obvious that those who burnt the school were sent by certain high-profile people which he did not want to disclose. It is obvious because certain schools including Muhovhini Primary were not torched. Those guys are responsible. We are now tired of this family. We will end up doing what we have done to the Xilebvu family,&#8221; Tivani said.The Xilebvu family were evicted by the community after the two brothers allegedly engaged in corrupt activities including stealing and rape.Muhovhini Primary is a Venda-dominated school in Kurhuleni, while Kurhuleni Primary is a Tsonga dominated school in the area.Sources told the New Age that perpetrators are planning to burn Ongedacht High School.The police are investigating the matter. No arrests have been made yet.-Hitekani Maimelanews@thenewage.co.za
