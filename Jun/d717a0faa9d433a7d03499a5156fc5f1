We are working on something exceptionally great for the supporters and most significantly honouring our father and leader in Dr Molemela. It is absolutely imperative to honour such icons while they are alive, Davis said.The album is scheduled to hit the shelves in August but some songs will be available before the end of next month on MTN Play for download.
