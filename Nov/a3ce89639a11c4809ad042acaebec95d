He has served in the Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions), ultimately as the Chief Special Investigator heading up the Free State Branch and He has rose to the rank of Brigadier while heading up the Commercial Crimes unit of the Hawks before becoming the Provincial Head in Gauteng.Sibiya was pushed out of his job in 2015 by the then acting Hawks head Major General Mthandazo Ntlemeza for allegedly taking part in the illegal rendition of five Zimbabwean nationals.He was found guilty of gross misconduct after a disciplinary inquiry into the renditions conducted by advocate Mxolisi Zondo.At the time the inquiry could not place General Sibiya on the scene, but said his cellphone records and his presence at Hawks offices indicated that he would have known about the deportation.However the commission findings were overturned by the Pretoria High Court that resulted in one of his co- accused Robert Mcbride being re-appointed as boss of Independent Police Investigation Directorate (IPID).&#8220;Mr Sibiya has a distinguished record that demonstrates someone who has served the people of this Country without fear or favor during the course of his work,&#8221; said Mashaba.Mashaba also urged the employees to come forward with any information regarding corruption.&#8220;My message to the corrupt within City of Johannesburg and you have operated for a long time with people looking the other way, those days are over,&#8221; said Mashaba.&#8220;There are many good civil servants in the City of Johannesburg, and to them I say come forward and know that you will not be persecuted or victimised. You will be protected and we will work with you to rid our City of corrupt people,&#8221; Mashaba concludedTNA Reporter
