In a move set to effect transformation in the construction industry, a giant in construction, Murray &amp; Roberts, is disposing of its infrastructure and building platform to a black-owned industry group, among others, for R314m.The company entered into an agreement with black-owned Southern Palace, the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and management to complete the transaction.The R314m deal excludes the liabilities related to the collapse of the Grayston pedestrian bridge as well as its open-cast mining contract with Lonmin.The transaction also excludes the Murray &amp; Roberts group of companies interests in the Bombela Concession Company, Bombela Civils Joint Venture, Bombela Operating Company and the Murray &amp; Roberts Middle East operations.Murray &amp; Roberts said the decision to dispose of the infrastructure and building platform will allow the group to become a focused project solutions service provider in selected natural resources market sectors. The sale of MRIB to a black-owned and controlled industrial group will create a large infrastructure and building business that may be highly successful in the sub-Saharan African construction market, the company said.The company said the disposal consideration will be applied to reduce the level of debt at Murray &amp; Roberts.The transaction consists of infrastructure, open-cast mining, power as well as commercial and residential buildings. Murray &amp; Roberts also announced the withdrawal of a cautionary announcement to shareholders when dealing in the company s securities following the announcement of the transaction.Last week, Murray &amp; Roberts sold its last remaining manufacturing business, Genrec, to Nisela Capital for R185m, also citing a need to focus on global natural resources markets.THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
