For the first time since 2009, the Department of Water and Sanitation s stringent financial discipline has paid off, making it the most improved government department to curtail excessive waste in the financial year 2015-16. This is a new era and it is something that should be commended.This should be so because the manner in which the department controls and deploys its financial resources has a material effect on the public s right to accessing water and dignified sanitation.Thus the department must operate within the parameters of good governance. It can only deviate from the framework if there should be reasonable and justifiable circumstances compelling enough for it to conduct its business in a manner that is at variance with the accepted norms and standards of financial conduct.Operating in a constrained financial environment, and acutely aware of the strain placed on the fiscus and competing government priorities, the department has done well to reduce its spending. This shows the department is on the right course to analyse and correct factors that contributed to it getting unfavourable audit opinions in the past financial years.By engaging in this analysis, the department has placed emphasis on appropriate responses to curtail runaway spending patterns that saw it receiving unfavourable report. As a result of this, department has placed itself in a position to enable it do more work to maximise the benefits that should be enjoyed by the public.The effect of the financial prudence displayed by the department will ensure that a greater number of the public have access to proper water and sanitation.Equally important, it would mean that the challenges of water and sanitation, which continue to pose a threat to many people, is effectively dealt with. The knock-on effect of this will be that those who previously did not enjoy the right to access to water and proper sanitation will now begin to lead healthy lives and enjoy these benefits.The communities are surely going to be empowered in the way they live their lives. This will not merely enhance the transformation trajectory, but will also ensure the public enjoy quality of life envisioned by the drafters of the our Constitution.The attainment of an unqualified audit report by the department will go a long way to restore the public s faith in running a tight ship when it comes to managing its finances. To deal with the acts of financial misconduct, the department has moved swiftly to bring to book officials who use state coffers meant for service delivery for personal gain.Because of these corrupt elements, the state is left paralysed, something that often leaves many communities high and dry .Kleptocracy within the public sector is a festering sore that leaves deep scars and compromises the well-being of society and the country. This has an adverse impact on the progression of the government s programmes aimed at improving the lives of the public. In turn, the government takes a lot criticism for its slow pace in addressing pressing delivery issues. To ensure that the department deals decisively with the scourge, it has put systems in place which move away from knee-jerk reaction when allegations of financial misconduct arise. These systems will instead proactively detect misdemeanours before they even occur.It is worth noting and appreciating the conundrum in which the department may from time to time find itself. The current drought that is sweeping across the country is causing untold misery to communities, some of whom were already facing water shortages even before the drought; the department has to make interventions. In doing so, it had to shift funds meant for one project or another to assist communities who find themselves in a desperate situation.This may affect planned projects or their progression, but then if this is done through following sound financial practices, and not in a manner that constitutes a financial misdemeanour, then that action is above board.Not acting on its own but responding to a situation dictated to it by the cataclysmic impact of the drought, the department has had to move funds from one project to bring respite to affected communities. And, this does not in any way amount to financial transgression.In all its action, and ultimately achieving the unqualified audit opinion, the department has acted in a manner consistent with its moral obligation to better the lives of the public.Hosia SitholeHosia Sithole is assistant director at the Department of Water and Sanitation (Gauteng region)
