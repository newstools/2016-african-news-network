German President Joachim Gauck said he was worried about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the race for the White House, citing the US Republican hopeful&#8217;s &#8220;unpredictability&#8221; as a cause for concern, according to a magazine interview published Sunday.&#8220;We can&#8217;t say what could be expected from a President Donald Trump,&#8221; Gauck told Germany&#8217;s Der Spiegel weekly. &#8220;To me, and to many people in the United States and here at home, this constitutes a problem.&#8221;With just two days to go in a closely fought election that is being watched around the world, Gauck added: &#8220;When I look at Washington, I am worried.&#8221;The German president, whose role is largely ceremonial, said he hoped &#8220;that American democracy, which does not allow the president to act as an autocrat, that the system of checks and balances, of mutual control&#8221; of power would be maintained.The latest major survey, the ABC/Washington Post tracker released early Sunday, gave Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton a five- percentage point 48-43 lead over Trump. Polling averages however are closer.-AFP
