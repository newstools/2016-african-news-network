If the 2017 U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) participants think South Africa will continue to be pushovers in the tournament they are in for a nasty surprise.This time coach Thabo Senong and his squad will be better prepared. Senong s plea to spend more time with the players and having a sound preparation plan has finally been heard.Senong, who concluded his week-long camp on Sunday, believes Amajita s chances to succeed are better as they will have enough time to prepare compared to last year. Next year s 20th edition of Afcon will take place in Zambia in February with Amajita drawn in Group A together with Senegal, Sudan and Cameroon.In last year s tournament in Senegal, Amajita failed to make it out of the group stages. Because of their third place finish in their Afcon group, Amajita missed the opportunity to participate in the 2015 Fifa U-20 World Cup in New Zealand. The difference between this year and last year is the amount of time we have to prepare for the Afcon. The tournament is next year and we have started with the preparations already as we were on a week long camp with the players, Senong said. In our preparation for Zambia, we are going to play no less than eight matches with the sides that are known for being tough in the continent as we are playing Kenya later this month. The venue and date for the match is yet to be confirmed by Safa.Amajita will also take part in the next month s U-20 Cosafa Cup in Rustenburg. In January, we are going to have a tour to play West African teams such as Mali and Guinea. We are also going to go to the north and will play nations such as Egypt, so that s the best preparation we can ask for. Some of the overseas-based players such as Liam Jordan and Thabo Cele couldn t join us but I hope they will make it for the next camp. SITHEMBISO DINDI |sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
