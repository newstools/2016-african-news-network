Airbnb has teamed up with Delta Air Lines in the US in a new partnership that will allow frequent flyer members to earn miles when they book their travel accommodations on Airbnb.It&#8217;s the latest partnership of its kind for the short-term vacation rental site. Last month, Qantas became the first carrier to sign on to the scheme.Frequent Delta fliers and SkyMiles members can now earn one mile per dollar spent on qualifying Airbnb stays.SkyMiles members who&#8217;ve never stayed at an Airbnb accommodation are also being enticed to sign up with up to 1,000 bonus miles and $25 coupon code.For Airbnb, the collaboration could be construed as a means to expand their reach and legitimize their brand at a time when it faces legal challenges around the world.Their latest challenge is in New York City, where Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a new law last month that makes it illegal for residents to list whole, unoccupied apartments on Airbnb for less than 30 days.Offenders face fines of up to $7,500.Airbnb has launched countersuit in New York, the latest in a string of legal battles around the world, from San Francisco to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Spain, and Berlin.To earn miles on their Airbnb accommodations, Delta loyalty members can book at delta.com/airbnb.-Relaxnews
