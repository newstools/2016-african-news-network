The wheels of omnibus South Africa are coming off, which means South Africans themselves not the middle class, not the working class, not the trade union movement and not the poor and certainly not business South Africa, but all the people of our country, working with a common purpose must work together to rebuild the crumbling edifice of the state. We must all learn afresh to have respect for the country s bible, the Constitution.For the people s assembly, people from all walks of life gathered at the St Alban s Cathedral church in Pretoria, Tshwane this week.It was significant that South Africans gathered at an Anglican church. By definition the Anglican Church, unlike the Roman Catholic Church, is a broad church, a pitiful breakaway from the rocklike church in Rome. The Anglican Church is not rocklike.Where there used to be a rock, this has been replaced with loose strands with a life of their own which have formed into what would be known as the broad church made up of the Anglo-Catholics, Evangelicals and the Liberals.To church historians, this is more complex than the description here which at its core represents English Reformation, the reformation that became revolutionary.During the church-state revolution the English church sought to reclaim its Englishness and in pursuit of this, the monasteries in England which prior to the revolution were a representation of entrenched Catholicism, were dissolved and incinerated in some cases, with only a few surviving the revolution of the time.This was because people were angry and wanted to destroy, to their own detriment, that which did not resonate with themselves or their ideology. It seemed to me that the revolution at the church this week was that kind of revolution where people of different political stripes came together to prosecute the noble ideals of a united and prosperous South Africa, although made up of different strands, committed to being rocklike like the Church of Rome. And the theme Save South Africa the campaign seemed appropriate. After all there is no reason to burn down monasteries because of political differences.The point about these histories is that they offer us a perspective and solid understanding that if and when the wheels come off in any situation, resulting in any dissolution of any sort, this must never be interpreted as a unique experience.Dissolution and the coming off of wheels happen all the time, whether we know it or not. Such aspects of life are a reflection of dissonance and marks great chasm between people s understanding of their own world.But that does not mean we should drift apart from one another and destroy each another because of disagreements. On the contrary, it means we need to engage in dialogue, to talk to each other even as we understand we are not rocklike, but we belong to a broad church of ideas.At the cathedral gathering, the voices of people who became fed up with what they refer to as state capture came together. As in the Anglican church and in the ANC, they were people from different schools of thoughts, a broad church , so to speak.The ANC is a broad church because within itself there are many strands the communists, nationalists, socialists, businessmen and business women, intellectuals, revolutionaries and the working class.Lawyers and a former judge were present at the gathering, as well as intellectuals, business people, trade unionists, members of the ANC, members of other political parties, including the EFF, DA, UDM and Azapo, among others, attended the Save SA campaign.It was former Constitutional Court judge Zak Yacoob who proved more scathing in his attack on President Jacob Zuma and even urged South Africans to use their votes to unseat the ANC from political power in the next national general election of 2019.Yacoob did not in his vitriol spare the DA and EFF or any other political party that may contest for political power.He argued that if such political parties failed to observe the Constitution, in whatever form and blatantly ignore the provisions of the Bill of Rights, in whatever manifestation, such parties were not worthy voting for.Like the ANC, they should not expect to be elevated to the levers of political power, urging the electorate to withhold their vote if there was a flagrant disrespect for the Constitution by political parties, particularly the ANC as the governing party.As the former Constitutional Court judge poured his heart out, members of all political parties cheered and ululated, which was a clear sign that they too were fed up with what they perceived to be going wrong in their country, noting that Yacoob no longer referred to the ANC as his political home as a result of the president s behaviour and his flagrant disrespect for the Constitution.At the drafting of the Constitution, he said, he was one of those who had argued strenuously against the insertion of an anti-corruption clause because in the heart of his heart he never thought that things would turn out to be what they are today, because the ANC was at the forefront of committing itself to a clean government of equal opportunities for all.Are the wheels coming off? Mark Hayward of Section 27 believed, as he lifted his overused and battered copy of the Constitution, that what will save South Africa is when all South Africans showed respect for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in the Constitution.Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela is a writer and commentator
