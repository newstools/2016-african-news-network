A veil of secrecy has been drawn over allegations that former public protector Thuli Madsonsela utilised the private cellphone records of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Des van Rooyen to implicate him in her state capture probe.The New Age was informed by sources that Van Rooyen has now requested the department of state security to probe how a newspaper was able to obtain information about his cellphone records.A report in a Sunday newspaper said Van Rooyen s cellphone records indicate he made several visits to the Gupta family s residence prior to him being appointed finance minister last year.The public protector s office as well as that of Van Rooyen have declined to comment on the report. Spokesperson for Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, Kgalalelo Masibi, said yesterday the report by the previous Public Protector Thuli Madonsela was under lock and key as ordered by the court. We can t comment on something alleged to be in the report, she said.Of the allegations that cellphone records apparently showed that Van Rooyen had visited the Gupta home for seven successive days before he replaced Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister she said it was not policy to comment on investigations.Her reply was the same when asked if a court application had been sought to examine Van Rooyen s cellphone records.Van Rooyen s spokesperson Legadima Leso said: Let s wait for the 1st of November and deal with it then. The minister went to court to interdict the report today, he said.The University of Cape Town s constitutional law expert Prof Pierre de Vos said yesterday that the public protector and other Chapter 9 institutions, such as the Human Rights Commission, have wide search and seize powers. She s basically like the National Prosecution Authority. She can do search and seizure in the president s office, he said. Repeated attempts to contact State Security spokesperson Brian Dube were unsuccessful.Dennis Cruywagendennisc@thenewage.co.za
