Gauteng is increasingly using technology to deliver services, as the world embraces the concept of e-government.Speaking at the 2016 Government Technology (GovTech) conference yesterday at the Gallagher Convention Centre, Gauteng premier David Makhura said together with municipalities, the provincial government was playing a leading role in using ICT to deliver education, healthcare and other government services to citizens and businesses.In education, the province has introduced interventions such as e-learning and e-information management.In health, innovations such the new digital patient information management system, the picture archiving and communication system (Pacs), is being piloted at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital.This ensures all MRIs, ultrasounds, X-rays and CAT scans are sent directly to computers so doctors and patients no longer have to wait for the hard copies to be printed and the electronic bed management system (eBMS) is piloted at the Steve Biko academic cluster allows medical staff to identify the location of available beds across each cluster.The digital patient information replaces the outdated and time-consuming manual filing system. Gauteng strives to be a smart province, with smart industries and a smart government, Makhura said.He said the new ICT revolution would change the way the government works and relates to citizens. Makhura said the ICT revolution would break down the walls of red tape and bureaucracy to empower citizens in an unprecedented manner.The province has established a specific department of e-Government to modernise the government and address the needs of the digital economy. The once cumbersome process of registering the database and submitting invoices have been replaced by an easy accessible process of registering online.Makhura said the ICT-enabled public service delivery offered an opportunity to improve efficiency and access to public services, developed the transparency and accountability of governments and empowered citizens to better participate in decision making processes.With the help of Sita, the implementation programme for the Gauteng Broadband network is on track and to date the provincial government has a 1500 km network of fibre linking 8 core nodes across the province.Makhura said by the end of this financial year, Gauteng would have completed connectivity to about 900 sites. He said that the provincial government was not alone in rolling out broadband access in the city region.The three large metros have rolled out 2 252km of fibre optic network to connect government entities. We ve defined our vision as a seamlessly integrated city region underpinned by an economy that is inclusive, innovation-driven and knowledgebased , Makhura said.Ntombi Nkosintombin@thenewage.co.za
