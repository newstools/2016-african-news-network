It has been nine months since the tragic Lily Mine collapse in Barberton, Mpumalanga, and the lives of three families who lost their loved ones in the collapse have gone from bad to worse.Christopher Mazibuko, husband of Pretty Nkambule, one of the miners who was in the container that sunk in February, said life has been hard, especially now as Christmas is approaching. We need money for clothes, food and other essentials. You know we have three children and they want to be like other kids in December but I do not know what to do, he said.Mazibuko said the children continued to cry for their mother. I even stopped explaining because you don t know what to say as we don t have her body and we do not know when or if ever we will be able to get to see her body again. Pretty was in a container with Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyarende when the mine collapsed and their container, which was on the surface, was buried while more than 70 workers who were underground survived the tragedy.The mine made a number of attempts to rescue the trapped workers but all failed as the ground was fragile, which put the lives of rescuers in danger.Lily Mine was declared unsafe and it applied for a business rescue as it was no longer operational.However, the mine has failed to secure an investor in the last nine months but business rescue practitioner Rob Devereux said they have not given up on saving Lily Mine. We are engaged with an overseas investor for the full amount required to reopen it and an announcement will be made in due course.The families still receive the full salary of the deceased employees and grants and support from the government as well as food parcels and free accommodation, as well as counselling and other support.
