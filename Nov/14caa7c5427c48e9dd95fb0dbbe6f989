There has been a decline in the number of children dying of malnutrition in South Africa, but the lack of nutrition continues to take a toll on many young lives.The national Department of Health says 1 380 children died between April last year and March this year, after 15 537 malnutrition cases were recorded. This performance was below the national target of 10%. We should note that the number of deaths as well as the fatality rate have declined from 1 672 deaths in 2013-14 with a fatality rate of 11.3%, Health Department spokesperson Joe Maila said.The department has cited food insecurity, poor sanitation and not identifying children at risk of malnutrition as some of the major problems. There are a number of factors that contribute including not breastfeeding, poor access and utilisation to nutrient rich foods, diarrhoea, pneumonia and living in overcrowded homes with poor water and sanitation facilities. Healthcare workers are not identifying children who are at high risk of malnutrition or acting in time to reverse the process of delayed growth or concurrent infections from HIV and TB, he said.Unplanned pregnancies and short birth spacing times have been identified as contributing factors.A recent World Health Organisation report found that malnourished children, especially those with severe acute malnutrition, have a higher risk of death from common childhood illness such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria. Nutrition-related issues were responsible for 45% of deaths in children under five years of age globally.The department said measures to tackle malnutrition included educating the public about the importance of breastfeeding and improving access to HIV-Aids treatment.It is estimated that South Africa has only 39% of mothers who breastfeed exclusively for 14 weeks. A number of interventions are in place to address the issues described including a national campaign to address public perception and behaviour on breastfeeding and strengthening the capacity of healthcare workers to adhere to standard clinical treatment protocols and evidence-based practice, Maila said.ZODIDI MHLANA |zodidim@thenewage.co.za
