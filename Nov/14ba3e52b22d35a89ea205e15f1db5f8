The ANC yesterday voted down a motion that former public protector Thuli Madonsela be invited to address Parliament.The proposal to invite Madonsela to address MPs was tabled by EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu, but was immediately opposed by ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu.When the matter was put to the vote the ANC shot down the motion with 183 votes to the 89 votes of opposition parties.Shivambu argued that Madonsela should be asked to address the National Assembly before the end of the parliamentary session.He said Madonsela could focus on her experiences during her tenure as public protector and the lessons that should be applied to all public representatives, public servants and the public in the provision of quality services for all. The heightened attention and high approval (of Madonsela) was due to the reality that her office treated all matters brought to her attention without fear or favour, the motion moved by Shivambu said.However, Mthembu was not persuaded by Shivambu, although he acknowledged Madonsela s contribution to our people, in among others, the fight against corruption and maladministration .Mthembu however insisted that Parliament was not inclined to debate the highlights and low-lights of Madonsela s legacy. The question before us today is a procedural one, he said.He said that former heads of Chapter 9 institutions have never been invited to address Parliament and that if Madonsela was invited, it would be the first time it happened. The draft resolution before us does not seek to persuade the House to invite advocate Madonsela in her capacity as a former head of a Chapter 9 institution, he said. It is to invite her in recognition of her contribution as an individual who happened to be a head of Chapter 9 institution. The question is, where do we draw the line. Shall this House invite outstanding judges, premiers, mayors, the list is endless, Mthembu said.Shivambu said he was disappointed because he had thought that Mthembu seemed different. What is wrong with just listening to a person who has gained experience in a specific field? -Dennis Cruywagen
