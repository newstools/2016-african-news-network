With many big malls around the country including the Mall of Africa in Midrand, closing at midnight on Friday, police and all other law-enforcement agencies will add more manpower to intensify festive season operations as the number of potential shoppers may increase today due to Black Friday hype.Many retail shops will be selling their goods at reduced prices to clear their stock in preparation for Christmas.Last year s Black Friday was marked by customers in some shops fighting over goods while others lost valuable possessions, even cars.Police have urged major shopping centres to step up security as criminals may also take the opportunity to prey on their customers. Shoplifting could also increase. Police will increase patrols until late to ensure the safety and security of people who will be going shopping.These patrols form part of the festive season patrols which have already been up and running since the beginning of this month, spokesperson for Gauteng province Col Lungelo Dlamini said. Members of the public will experience more roadblocks and stop and search operations. Police are also deploying plainclothes police officers to follow up on any suspicious people and criminals, Dlamini said. Suspicious people and vehicles should also be reported to the police or the nearest police station Avoid carrying or withdrawing large amounts of cash Check if you are being followed Report any criminal activity to Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or to the nearest police station at all hours.Ntombi Nkosi | ntombin@thenewage.co.za
