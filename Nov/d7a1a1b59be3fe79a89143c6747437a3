The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has welcomed the jail sentence handed down to four men who were involved in an incident in which 41 donkeys were killed while travelling from Limpopo on a truck apparently en route to Randfontein.The four foreign nationals were sentenced to eight months imprisonment each without the option of a fine.Sougson Manasseh, Madhihwa Mjasha, Target Murima and Amoni Chirwa admitted guilt to criminal charges of cruelty to animals in terms of the Animal Protection Act No 71 of 1962.The men were travelling from Limpopo, apparently on their way to an abattoir in Randfontein, with the donkeys loaded on the truck.Adult males, females and foals were all in the same compartment with most of the animals in a state of collapse, crushed, dead or dying. Their vehicle was intercepted by personnel from the Polokwane SPCA last September. Tragically, this is not an isolated issue and the NSPCA continues to pursue leads to uncover and handle further instances of donkeys being stolen and abused in terms of transportation and general neglect, Grace de Lange of the SPCA said. Donkeys are slaughtered in an unacceptable manner for the trade in donkey hides for Chinese traditional medicine. The NSPCA said it was highly disturbed by the practice, which was widespread and growing.It applauded the magistrate and the state prosecutor who acted swiftly and were instrumental in ensuring that justice was served.Kutullo Madishakutullom@thenewage.co.za
