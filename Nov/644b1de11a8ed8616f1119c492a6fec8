Drought-stricken South Africa is in for higher than normal rainfalls this summer but the rains will not be enough to break the prolonged and devastating dry spell. Extreme rainfall conditions are expected during the summer period. An enhanced above normal rainfall is predicated during the early and mid summer season, South African Weather Service s (SAWS ) Lucky Ntsangwane said.For more than a year the country has been in the throes of its worst drought since 1997 and good rains are necessary to break the dry cycle. We are still in a drought situation and the recovery from it is expected to be slow. We need to get constantly good rains for about two years in order to experience relief from the drought, Ntsangwane said. The drought is being severely aggravated by the El Ni o phenomenon. Department of Water Affairs deputy director-general Trevor Balzer said the water restrictions implemented in some municipalities would remain until May next year. In May 2017, they will review if there s a need to relax or intensify the current restrictions. Municipalities are obliged to implement water restrictions, Balzer said.Ntsangwane also predicated a weak La Ni a condition following the El Ni o phase. We see a weak La Nina which is expected to decay, he said.Weather forecaster Mkhushulwa Msimanga said higher than normal temperatures were experienced during the month of October.Temperatures in the Free State and the North West rose to the high 30s. Gauteng, North West, Free State and Mpumalanga and Limpopo are recovering from a four-day heat wave. The fact that we are breaking records of maximum temperatures show that we are affected by climate change, Msimanga said.July this year was recorded as the hottest month on record since records commenced in 1880. It is also predicted that 2016 is going to be the hottest year on record. It is also predicted that South Africa will take two to five years to recover from the devastating drought.Zodidi Mhlanazodidim@thenewage.co.za
