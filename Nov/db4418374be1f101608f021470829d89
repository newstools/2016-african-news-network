Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has labelled accusations that his girlfriend benefited R30 million as &#8216;lies&#8217; saying the allegations raise much concern as to why this lie was told to begin with.&#8220;No media report has provided even a shred of evidence to the fact that Indoni was paid over R30 million by the ministry of police/civilian secretariat for police,&#8221; said Nhleko during a press conference on Tuesday.Reports emerged on Sunday alleging that Nhleko had a hand in the awarding of a R30 million tender to Nomcebo Mthembu&#8217;s company, for organising the We Are One Humanity workshops and events to raise awareness against xenophobia after violence against foreigners broke out in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng last year.&#8220;Indoni as the organisation that assisted with the conceptualisation of a response to the xenophobic attacks was identified as a relevant strategic partner to work on the programme and they were identified mainly because they had an existing memorandum of understanding with the ministry and they were also based in KZN,&#8221; said Nhleko.&#8220;It will also be interesting that at the time the xenophobic attacks took place, the budget stood at R6 milion. The civil secretary of police services couldn&#8217;t have paid R30 million as alleged in the media reports,&#8221; continued Nhleko.According to Nhleko, the relationship between Indoni and the ministry of police is managed in line with the policy prescription of governance and the existing Memorandum Of Understanding.The Police Minister also questioned why it was only the City Press which had picked up the alleged financial irregularity and not Parliament or the Auditor General.&#8220;Suppose these deviations of this magnitude took place, that means all of our budget went to one organisation,&#8221; said Nhleko.After media reports and an indication by the Democratic Alliance(DA) that it would be laying a complaint against Nhleko for contravening the Executive Ethics code, the Minister revealed that he had reported the matter to President Jacob Zuma in order to appraise him on the key issues.Nhleko also revealed that he had written to the Office of the Public Protector requesting they investigate the allegations.&#8220;It is essential that the matter is clarified because these are serious allegations and need the Public Protector to investigate,&#8221; said Nhleko.&#8220;We have also assigned the accounting officer in the civil secretariat for police Service to engage the services of the public service commission to investigate the matter in the interest of good governance and accountability,&#8221; continued Nhleko.Sphiwe Mchunu
