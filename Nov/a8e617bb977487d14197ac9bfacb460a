A close ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism Sunday for saying the Facebook posts of journalists showed they wanted to impose a &#8220;leftwing&#8221; agenda in public broadcasting.A journalists&#8217; union said his comments evoked the McCarthyism of the 1950s in the United States, when US Senator Joseph McCarthy accused communists of infiltrating the government.David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu&#8217;s governing coalition and a member of parliament from the premier&#8217;s Likud party, said he did not want to see &#8220;leftwing people impose their agenda in the public service as they say&#8221; on their Facebook pages.&#8220;We followed the messages of these journalists on Facebook,&#8221; he said.Bitan, a firebrand rightwing politician who has made controversial statements in the past, declined to provide examples of the Facebook posts.He first made the comments at an event on Saturday and repeated his accusations on Sunday in an interview with army radio.The Union of Journalists in Israel called on the attorney general to investigate whether Bitan had violated journalists&#8217; privacy.The claims come amid a dispute over the future of public broadcasting in Israel.Netanyahu is accused of seeking to derail the formation of a new public broadcasting corporation because it will include journalists he sees as biased against him.Bitan says the Facebook posts he found proves the new corporation would be leftwing.The new corporation would replace the existing Israel Broadcasting Authority in a bid to make it more cost-efficient and effective.-AFP
