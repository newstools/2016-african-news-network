The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) will on Friday pay tribute to all traffic and metro officers who died in uniform between November 2015 and November 2016.A wreath will be laid to honour all traffic officers from all provinces and municipalities. The event is scheduled to take place at the Boekenhoutkloof Traffic Training College in Pretoria West.The event is hosted by RTMC in collaboration with the Institute of Traffic and Municipal Police of South Africa, The Institute of Licensing Officers of South African, provincial department of roads and traffic as well as municipal traffic departments.RTMC spokesperson outlined that it is the third time that the organisation is hosting such an event. This is the third time we as RTMC are participating in a such event. It has been happening in a small scale since 1993, RTMC Spokesperson Simon ZwaneA total of 18 Traffic officers have died in the line of duty in the past year. The numbers seem to be slightly more then the previous on that we had. It reflex on slot that we have seen against law enforcement officials generally, to reduce that we have increased the training that we proved to our officers and making sure that they work in pairs but not individuals, Zwane said.In August a 60-year-old metro police officer was brutally killed during an armed robbery at Junction Mall in Rosettenville.The officer reportedly saw suspects robbing security guards of a cash box.When he confronted the suspect, he was shot twice in the upper body by another suspect who came out from behind a pillar.In August RTMC condemned the killing of law enforcement officers. These unwarranted attacks against law enforcement officers are totally unacceptable and we call on the members of the public to work with the police to bring an end to these killings.Law enforcement officers have made it their duty to serve and protect society, it is therefore the responsibility of each and every citizen to defend them when they come under attack for doing their work, said the RTMC CEO Advocate Makhosini Msibi.In 2015 Acting Transport Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi urged traffic officers across the country to honour their fallen colleagues by tightening law enforcement on the roads.&#8220;This had to be done without compromise, especially with the festive season around the corner. It is for this reason that that we must continue to do everything in our power to reduce the carnage on our roads, Ramathlodi said.Since 1993 more than 300 officers have been honored in this manner, meanwhile Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters is expected to address delegates from different provinces, MEC s,Traffic Chiefs, and families of the deceased who will be attending the event.-Simangele Legodi
