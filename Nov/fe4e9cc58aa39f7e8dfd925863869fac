It is every matriculant s dream, let alone parents to have the opportunity for further education and training.It is even a miracle for those residing in the deepest of the rural areas, having been raised in poverty to pay for an expensive education.It wouldn t be a matter of exaggeration putting forth that education is getting expensive and is continuing to sideline bright young people with academic abilities raised in poverty with no prospect of paying for their fees.With an average increase of 10% each year, if not more, one may work on mathematical skills to project just how expensive education will be in the next coming years should students and parents not act upon it now.Making reference to the rate of unemployment and of poverty we face, particularly in the rural areas, where in fact education is most needed, should the government continue with an increase in fees?We are coming to the point of having quite a number of students being turned away due to the unreasonably high fees.Even now we have young people with potential for academic education staying at home because parents can t afford the fees.So, whether students are acting a bit irrational or inappropriate, whichever you prefer, even a half-minded man could tell, that students frustrations are to the sense making education level, fair and democratic.Education is the key to success, so they say.But with a restrictive condition of having to pay expensive fees to acquire it, students are then being indirectly restricted from achieving their true potential.If education is the key, we therefore are facing a country with no chance of success.We are on a drive to having a country that is resourceless, with no valuable skills, forcing the youth to get skills from other countries.There s a low number of graduates, not because they don t want to go to school, but because there is a barrier restricting them from acquiring skills. One may guess as to what that barrier could be.The youth are excluded from the keys to success by unreasonably high fees and that s that. But who administers that barrier? Our government.The #FeesMustFall movement is an initiative that speaks for the voiceless.It speaks on behalf of those being restricted from the keys to success, by the high fees. It speaks for the parents who are being forced to pay a registration fee that is twice if not more than their annual salaries.So it shouldn t be seen as a movement of young students wanting to save money for their next party, not at all!Parents are continuously getting deeper and deeper into the trap of debt in pursuit of wanting to pay expensive fees so as to guarantee a brighter future for their children,Young people are sitting at home because they cannot afford the fees, yet the government sees nothing wrong with that.So instead of having the government empowering the youth by allowing them access to free education as an investor would, it is constantly failing them.There s hardly empathy for those in the struggle for a free education. Instead of eradicating poverty, the government is burdening the poor who are eager to acquire education to change their lives.The fact of the matter is that high fees act as a major barrier between the youth and success, restricting them of their right to an education.Students are fighting for their future, students are fighting for the only thing that could drive them out of poverty.But no, they are not taken seriously.It is more like the government would rather see them turning to criminal activities, drugs, prostitution and being called blessees.Mandela did say education is the only thing one can use to change lives.Hear the cries of the students, that peace may be the resolution.Students are willing to fight and so is the government.They are even making fun talking about it.Where, as a country, are we headed?Mmoloki MolebogeMmoloki Moleboge is a writer and commentator
