Almost four months after undergoing reconstructive surgery, Lesotho Times editor Lloyd Mutungamiri is on a slow and painful road to recovery.The Zimbabwean-born Mutungamiri has been in South Africa since July after he was shot at close range at his home in Maseru, Lesotho just after putting to bed the Sunday Express, a sister publication of the Lesotho Times.The CEO of Africa Media Holdings, the paper s publisher, Basildon Peta said although Mutungamiri would never be the same, he was at least starting to eat solids again after weeks of being on liquids only.His lower jaw was shattered and he had to undergo surgery at a hospital in Bloemfontein.Mutungamiri and his family have been living in South Africa since the incident. He cannot go back to Lesotho. He fears that the people who attacked him may think he will recognise them and finish what they started. He is not in a position to work, according to Peta.Peta said Mutungamiri was still not ready to talk about what happened to him on the day of what was believed to have been an assassination attempt. He was even more traumatised by the fact that there had been no word from law enforcement in Lesotho on progress in the case.Before the shooting, Mutungamiri had been summoned by the police and interrogated over a series of stories which had been published by the paper which were declared to have upset the military in that country.He was also charged for satirical comment relating to country s army general. Mutungamiri worked at Public Eye and the Informative after leaving his post as sports editor of The Standard in Zimbabwe.snn4@thenewage.co.za
