Pope Francis on Sunday celebrated Mass before a thousand prisoners specially invited to the Vatican, giving them a message of hope while denouncing the &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; of society.The event was also attended by 3,000 others including prison staff and volunteers and without any visible police presence.The Argentine pontiff regularly meets prisoners &#8212; both in Italy and on his trips abroad &#8212; but this is the first time so many inmates were received at the Vatican.The pontiff, recalling his visits to jail, said: &#8220;Every time I enter a prison, I ask the question &#8216;why them and not me?&#8217;, we all can make mistakes.&#8221;The prisoners came from jails in Italy and Spain but 12 countries were represented including Britain, Mexico, South Africa.He exhorted them never to lose hope.&#8220;Hope is a gift of God,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Certainly, breaking the law involves paying the price, and losing one s freedom is the worst part of serving time, because it affects us so deeply. All the same, hope must not falter.&#8221;He said that incarceration was not the only means to set people back on the right path.&#8220;Sometimes, a certain hypocrisy leads to people considering you only as wrongdoers, for whom prison is the sole answer,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We don t think about the possibility that people can change their lives; we put little trust in rehabilitation. But in this way we forget that we are all sinners and often, without being aware of it, we too are prisoners&#8230; locked up within our own prejudices or enslaved to the idols of a false sense of well-being.&#8221;-Reuters
