MP&#8217;s in Parliament&#8217;s Communications Committee have accused Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) of &#8220;complacency&#8221; after not penalising the SABC for failing to comply with its violent protest ruling.This comes after ICASA acting chair Rubben Mohlaloga told the committee that ICASA was still waiting on a SABC Board resolution to confirm whether the state broadcaster was complying with the violent protests ruling.In May the SABC made decision &#8220;that it will not show footage of people burning public institutions like schools in any of its news bulletins with immediate effect, we are not going to provide publicity to such actions that are destructive and aggressive. Back in July the Compliance Council recommended the SABC withdraw its resolution.The ruling required the broadcaster s board chairperson to confirm in writing within seven days from the date on which the order is served that the resolution as endorsed by council of the authority was taken as ordered. After its ruling on the violent protest ban, ICASA gave SABC 7 days to respond &amp; implement. To date, the SABC has not responded. Shocking Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) November 1, 2016According to Mohlaloga, the SABC has written to the regulatory body saying it accepted the ruling however had failed to comply with aspects of the ruling.ANC MP Mondli Gungubele said ICASA should impose penalties against the SABC for non compliance while Phumzille Van Damme representing the DA called for clear deadlines indicating when penalties against the SABC would take effect.However, according to ICASA its ongoing monitoring of SABC news broadcasts have not yet shown that the broadcaster continues to ban violent protests and ICASA would therefore not seek an order for a SABC Board resolution.The regulatory body however also conceeded that it did not have adequate representation nationwide to monitor compliance emanating from its rulingsMeanwhile the Committee is also scheduled to hear deliberations about the public broadcasters request that its licensing conditions be changed to remove the requirement that it air news during prime time.In terms of its license conditions, the SABC is obliged to have 3 1/2 hours of news programming during prime time. pic.twitter.com/CRG6pnmwXc Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) November 1, 2016However on Monday ICASA issued a statement saying that &#8220;there is no such application from the SABC which is under consideration by the Authority.&#8221;&#8211;TNA Reporter
