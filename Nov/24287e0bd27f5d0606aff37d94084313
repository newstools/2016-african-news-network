A 55-year-old man has been sentenced to life imprisonment for arson, attempted murder and rape at the Ladysmith Regional Court.KwaZulu-Natal acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa said the suspect Alfred Jabulani Mahlamba assaulted a 56-year-old woman in February of 2008.Mahlamba is sentenced to three years imprisonment for arson, six years imprisonment for attempted murder and life imprisonment for rape.&#8220;He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm,&#8221; said Langa.It is alleged the victim was at her home in the Elandslaagte area when someone threw a lit object into the house which started a fire, she then shouted for help when a man entered her home.The police said the woman thought the man was coming to her rescue but instead he severely assaulted her with a metal pipe and later raped her.The case was investigated by Ladysmith Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS).&#8220;The recent convictions by the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units in KZN proves that the police officers are committed in putting the rapist behind the bars for a long time.&#8220;As we are about to celebrate 16 Days of No Violence Against Women and Children, we appeal to victims of abuse to report such cases to the police even if they are being intimidated,&#8221; Langa said.-TNA Reporter
