Recommendations for the 2016/17 annual pay packages of public officers including a number of South Africa&#8217;s most senior government officials such as The President will on Friday be tabled by the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers (Commission).The Commission in a gazetted notice on Friday recommended that a zero increase be implemented for the 2016/17 financial year, citing financial constraints on the national economy. The proposed zero adjustment of the salaries of these public office bearers is a suggestion that all citizens should be aware of our economic situation and make sacrifices in order to avoid the economic meltdown,&#8221; reads the gazette.&#8220;Commission therefore calls on the affected POBs to view the zero adjustment as a patriotic sacrfice, continues the Gazette.According to the Commission, Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan &#8220;emphasized the issue of the deteriorating state of the South African economy and the increasing constraints exerted on the fiscus&#8221;, when the commission consulted with him.According to its recommendation, members of the National Executive, National Parliament, Provincial Executive, Provincial Legislature, and some positions within local government and traditional leadership will receive no increase to their pay package.The Commission said with respect to traditional leaders already earning relatively higher than their subjects, &#8220;it discourages a situation where Traditional Leaders would live in relative comfort while their subjects or constituencies face abject poverty.&#8221;Back in March the National Assembly approved President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s annual salary to increase to R2.8 million. Hundred and seventy two MPs in the National Assembly voted for Zuma to receive a salary increase while 82 voted against.The Commission back in November 2015 had a 5% salary increase for the President and other public office bearers for the 2015-2016 financial year.&#8211;TNA Reporter
