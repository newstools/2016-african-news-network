South Gauteng High court Judge Van der Linde has on Thursday dismissed the urgent application by a group of Witwatersrand University students seeking to halt final examinations.This comes after a group of students, supported by Socio-Economics Rights Institute (Seri), launched an urgent application to interdict the exams at the university.Students want examinations to be halted for at least two weeks, as time to prepare for their finals was minimal due to the #FeesMustFall protests, a call for free higher education, across universities in the country.Van der Linde handed down the judgement citing that there was lack of evidence and violation of constitutional rights of others.He added that in their application, students cited stress and non conducive environment to be able to prepare for exams as one of the reasons of examination postponement.Van der Linde said the right to protest must be exercised within the law which some students failed to do.&#8220;The University confirms that examinations will continue as scheduled.&#8220;The University has informed individuals who have good reason not to sit for an examination, that the individuals can apply for a deferred examination,&#8221; the institution said.Suspended, arrested and traumatised Wits University students who were part of the #FeesMustFall protests have a chance to write their final examinations in January.Meanwhile, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) Fees Must Fall movement has also called for final examinations, which commence on Monday, to be cancelled.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
