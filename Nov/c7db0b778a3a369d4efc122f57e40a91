Suspended , arrested and traumatised Wits University students who were part of the #FeesMustFall protests have a chance to write their final examinations in January.More than 10 students have been suspended by the university since the protests erupted late September.Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said the decision to allow them to write examinations this year would depend on their suspension conditions.Student activist Mcebo Dlamini who has been detained at Johannesburg Prison will also miss examinations which commence tomorrow as his next court appearance is scheduled for November 15. Patel said students who were not up for the examinations could write next month or in January. They can write deferred examinations in December or January as per Wits usual processes. We remind students that if they feel traumatised and for a good reason cannot sit for the examinations, they can apply to write deferred examinations, she said.Meanwhile, at the Tshwane University of Technology normality has prevailed and classes continued yesterday.TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said: Disruptions by a small group of protesters were experienced at the Soshanguve campuses on Monday and again yesterday. She said the university had been investigating the causes of the ongoing disruptions and had acted against perpetrators in accordance with the student disciplinary code. During the investigation, it transpired that a number of these perpetrators of violent protest actions had not been successful in their studies and did not qualify to sit for exams this year. The vice-chancellor and principal Lourens van Staden yesterday morning also suspended seven students for violating the urgent court order obtained on October 13, therefore they will not be allowed to enter the university, she said.De Ruyter said students found to be in contravention of the interim court order which barred students from protesting would be detained and be subjected to internal disciplinary procedures. Students are requested to attend classes and prepare for the remaining tests that have been scheduled.Students are encouraged to utilise myTutor and other virtual platforms, she said.BATANDWA MALINGO | batandwam@thenewage.co.za
