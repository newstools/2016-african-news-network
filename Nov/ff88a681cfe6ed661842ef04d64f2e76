It has barely been a week into the official start of the 2016 National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations and already a matric paper has been leaked.The Department of Basic Education (DBE) said pupils at a few schools in Giyani, Limpopo had access to the second paper of the mathematics examination, which was written on Monday. It was not immediately clear how the paper was leaked. We are going to quarantine all the scripts of the schools in the area to establish if there are any patterns. A team from DBE and province are working together with law enforcement to get to the bottom of this matter so that we can take appropriate action, spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said.He said the Hawks and SAPS would be investigating the security breach.Before the start of the examinations quality assurer Umalusi expressed concern about the storage facilities in Limpopo and the Eastern Cape.The body said the two provinces still had a challenge of staff shortages and that the DBE should intensify monitoring in the provinces to mitigate any unintended consequences of the situation.Following the leaking of the life sciences paper 2 in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Gauteng last year, Umalusi said the security of examination materials had become one of its focal points in the preparations this year.CEO Mafu Rakometsi said drastic measures would be taken against any pupils, teachers and department officials found guilty of copying, paper leaks and other forms of cheating.The department said while all exam centres would be audited, centres classified as high risk and independent centres would receive greater priority. The department would like to assure learners, parents and other stakeholders that it is has taken extraordinary measures to safeguard the integrity of these exams and would work to expose and charge those behind the incident of the maths exam paper in Limpopo, Mhlanga said.The department said it would do everything possible to maintain a high level of security across the country and cautioned pupils not to take part in the criminal acts. We appeal to pupils, parents and members of the community to report any incidents of papers being leaked and expose those behind the acts.
