With Donald Trump&#8217;s election sparking questions about the respect for democratic norms at home, US President Barack Obama made a strident case for democracy Saturday and urged world leaders to give his successor a chance.Speaking to young Latin Americans in Lima, Peru, Obama argued that democracy and development go hand-in-hand, and that authoritarian governments ultimately fail.With China and Russia seen as major global beneficiaries of Trump&#8217;s election victory, Obama acknowledged that questions were being raised about the post-Cold War primacy of democracy. &#8220;After a decade in which we have seen more and more countries adopt democratic practices, you are now starting to see some of those gains reversed,&#8221; Obama said.But, he added, governments that stifle opposition, do not expect the rule of law or an independent judiciary, are destined to fail.&#8220;Over time, those governments fail and those economies fail,&#8221; he said, while admitting that &#8220;democracy can be frustrating.&#8221;Obama is in Peru for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, his last stop on his last foreign trip.He faces a barrage of questions about Trump, whose campaign promises threaten to upend decades-long US commitments to NATO and defense obligations in Asia.Trump has also opposed a 12-nation Pacific trade deal and backed by key allies like Japan.&#8220;The United States is such a big country that after any election people are uncertain,&#8221; Obama said.&#8220;It will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments but to give this president elect a chance.&#8221;&#8220;With respect to Latin American, I don t anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration,&#8221; he said, echoing his administration&#8217;s position that Trump&#8217;s election has not fundamental altered US interests.&#8220;How you campaign isn&#8217;t always the same as how you govern,&#8221; he said.-AFP
