Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela alongside Communications Minister Faith Muthambi are some of the witnesses the Ad Hoc Committee probing the SABC Board, will call on to provide evidence.The Committee met on Tuesday to elect ANC MP Vincent Smith as the chair of the parliamentary ad hoc committee to inquire into the SABC s actions.The suggestion to invite Madonsela as a witness to address the committee was motivated by the fact that she previously wrote the &#8220;When Governance &amp; Ethics Fail&#8221; report on the SABC. The move was supported by all parties represented in the committee.&#8220;We will invite these identified witnesses and they do however have the right to decline to participate in the process,&#8221; said Smith.It was Madonsela s February 2014 probe which found among others that former SABC Chief Operations Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng had misrepresented his qualifications and purged senior staff members.According to Smith, the committee will send out a letter to all witnesses by end of business on Wednesday and has indicated that the committee should be done with all its work by 15th February 2017.Veteran journalist Sophie Mokoena was also added to the witness list following a suggestion by the EFF&#8217;s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.SABC Company Secretary Theresa Geldenhuys whose initial omission from the witness list was described as a glaring omission by MP&#8217;s, was also added to the list.The chairperson added that hearings into the SABC board&#8217;s fitness to hold office will begin on 29 November.The committee on Tuesday also resolved that witnesses, who did not want to provide evidence before cameras, should be allowed to do so following reports of alleged intimidation against some SABC8 journalists.&#8220;I have already requested that protection be given to the SABC 8 because we are dealing with people with mafia tendencies and our witnesses must be protected,&#8221; said Phumzille Van Damme of the Democratic Alliance(DA).The ANC&#8217;s Patrick Chauke condemned the reports of intimidation against journalists saying &#8221; we should engage SAPS asap as this Committee because it can&#8217;t be that journalists are intimidated and nobody says anything.&#8221;Meanwhile, two more board members Nomvuyo Mhlakaza and Aaron Tshidzumba handed in their resignations leaving Chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe as the only non-executive member.President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday accepted the resignations of the board members.Congress of the People(Cope) has called on Hlaudi Motsoeneng to also resign from the broadcaster.&#8220;We have repeatedly said that the board was not fit to do the job and called upon the Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi to dissolve it but she couldn t do it. We are now pleased that the board ended up dissolving itself,&#8221; said Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem.The SABC board is now down to one member and cannot form a quorum and is legally unable to meet.&#8211;Siphiwe Mchunu
