While the Democratic Alliance(DA) prepares itself to field a motion of no confidence debate in the National Assembly, the African National Congress(ANC) has insisted the motion will be defeated.The ANC s parliamentary caucus on Wednesday poured cold water on rumours that some of the party s MPs would revolt and vote in support of the DA s motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Talk of a revolt among some MPs gained traction on Wednesday following remarks made by ANC veterans Mavuso Msimang and Fazel Randera in an SABC radio interview.The duo s comments that MPs must vote with their conscience is being interpreted as a call to support the DA motion.Another senior veteran Sydney Mufamadi said that Msimang and Randera were articulating views that were not representative of the group of veterans who were seeking an audience with Zuma.The DA said it is bringing forward the motion following the release of Thuli Madonsela&#8217;s State of Capture Report and would be urging members of the ANC to vote with their conscience.&#8220;It is&#8230;incumbent upon the National Assembly s ANC Members, who derive their mandate from the people and Constitution, to act in terms of the highest law in the land and to respond to the calls of the people for President Zuma to be removed from office,&#8221; said DA leader Mmusi Maimane.Today s MONC presents the ANC with an opportunity to show that it is the listening and humble organisation it proclaims to be. #ZumaOrSA https://t.co/RpeYupUM4l Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) November 10, 2016Maimane also defended the motion saying it was not a call for regime change but was rather &#8220;a call to restore the integrity of SA and the Presidency.&#8221;However the ANC in Parliament has rubbished the motion calling it &#8220;frivolous.&#8221;&#8220;The frivolity of this motion is that it claims guilt of state capture on the part of the President when none in fact exist in the report,&#8221; said ANC Parliamentary Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo.&#8220;By calling for this motion, ostensibly on account of the Public Protector&#8217;s State of Capture report, the DA is deliberately putting the cart before the horse. The report of the Public Protector has not made any definitive guilty findings or conclusive orders against any implicated individual, let alone President Jacob Zuma,&#8221; continued Mothapo.Meanwhile Secretary General Gwede Mantshe has also criticised the motion saying it was a sign of growing arrogance in the opposition.&#8220;To think that they can convince members of the ANC to vote along with their motion we interpret as a sign of growing arrogance on the part of the DA,&#8221; said Mantashe during a press conference where the party was reporting back following their National Working Committee (NWC) meeting which was held on Monday.He further dismissed the impending no confidence debate saying the DA had caused the motion to lose its meaning due to bringing it up repeatedly.Last year a similar motion was predictably defeated by an ANC majority when a total of 221 members voted against it and 113 were in favour.The ANC in 2012 blocked then DA Parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko&#8217;s motion altogether from being debated in the national Assembly.-TNA Reporter
