ANC Gauteng Chairperson Paul Mashatile on Tuesday said while the party welcomes the National Prosecuting Authority&#8217;s decision to withdraw fraud charges against Pravin Gordhan, they remain concerned about reasons for charging him in the first place.&#8220;We believe the NPA should only go to court to charge citizens when they have a solid case and it appears that this was not so it really worries us what the motive was,&#8221; Mashatile said in a 702 interview Tuesday morning.Mashatile was reacting to Monday&#8217;s announcement, by NPA boss Shaun Abrahams, to drop fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former SARS officials Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula.&#8220;If you go to court and charge citizens for no solid reasons it means there may be other reasons we don&#8217;t know because we believe the NPA must lead without fear or favour,&#8221; said Mashatile on Tuesday.Mashatile criticised the decision to institute charges against the trio without having a solid case adding that such decisions tend to have a negative effect on the country&#8217;s economy.&#8220;We are in charge of the biggest [provincial] economy in the country and it is the second time we get plunged into a crises where the Rand plummets and the economy is affected and we don&#8217;t want people taking frivolous decisions which affect the economy,&#8221; said Mashatile.The rand rallied to a four-week high on Monday after fraud charges against Gordhan were dropped firming 1.6% against the dollar to R13.54/$.Mashtile on Tuesday added that there needs to be accountability after such a decision was taken.&#8220;In any normal democracy after a blunder like the one we see with the NPA there must be accountability. Its not always resigning but someone must step up and say I made a mistake which i will correct but currently it seems like its a free for all and people don&#8217;t care and that suggests a weakness in leadership,&#8221; said Mashatile.Calls for Abrahams to step down have been mounting since his decision, with the Law Society of South Africa amongst others saying Abrahams must be held accountable for bringing the criminal justice system into disrepute. &#8220;The LSSA urges Abrahams to consider his position in the light of the severe consequences his actions had on our economy, it said.Opposition parties including the DA, EFF, ACDP and COPE have also called for Abrahams to step down.Read: Parties remain committed to march calling for Abrahams resignationThe ANC called on President Zuma to &#8220;engage the NPA leadership to avoid a repeat of this and to protect the independence and integrity of the NPA.&#8221;Abrahams said on Monday: I certainly do not owe anybody an apology,&#8221; adding that he would not be stepping down from his position.Abrahams said he was satisfied Gordhan, Pillay and Magashula had no intention to act unlawfully and he withdrew the summons after SARS deputy director of law Vlok Symington made an affidavit which the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law used to file an application to the North Gauteng High Court requesting that the fraud charges be set aside.-TNA Reporter
