Wits University is pushing ahead with final examinations today while some students who want to halt examinations await a ruling by the South Gauteng High Court.The students supported by the Socio-Economics Rights Institute (Seri) applied for an interdict in the high court on Monday to stop the university from commencing with its final examinations today.They want examinations to be halted for at least two weeks. In their affidavit to the court, the students argue that students have been left with very little time to prepare for the final examinations due to the #FeesMustFall protests, which commenced on September 19.They said should examinations continue that would result in many students failing or underachieving. The university has said that it would continue with examinations this morning. The university has informed individuals who have good reason not to sit for an examination that the individuals can apply for a deferred examination (December/January).The university confirms that examinations will continue as scheduled, Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said. She said the university had beefed up security to ensure examinations were not disrupted. Students must arrive 50 minutes before the exam to go through the appropriate checks. While we strongly discourage students from bringing bags to examination venues, they will be accommodated outside examination venues if required, she said.Meanwhile, the University of KwaZulu-Natal has extended its academic programme by a month with examinations now expected to start on November 30 and end mid-December. This decision followed a series of disruptions during the #FeesMustFall protests.The University of the Western Cape #FeesMustFall movement has also called for final examinations, which commence on Monday to be cancelled as some students are not ready .The movement said students were not allowed to use university facilities during the shutdown and that was one of the reasons which placed them at a disadvantage.UWC management has however resolved to continue with examinations on Monday and students who do not wish to write the examinations have an option of writing in January.BATANDWA MALINGO |batandwam@thenewage.co.za
