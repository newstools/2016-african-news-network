Each year&#8217;s iPhone release gives rise to a host of rumors about what the next model will bring.Among other rumors, specialist websites are already suggesting an OLED screen and wireless charging for the iPhone 8, expected in 2017, marking the 10th anniversary of the famous Apple smartphone, which revolutionized the cell phone market and mobile web use.The Nikkei Asian Review website reports that the next iPhone could be getting an OLED screen, replacing the current LCD technology with organic light-emitting diodes.OLED displays have several advantages, such as deeper blacks and higher contrast. They can also make for slimmer and lighter designs while improving power efficiency.OLED technology could allow Apple to introduce varying degrees of curvature to its phones, as already seen in arch-rival Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S7 edge.This could give rise to three versions of a new iPhone (classic, Plus and a curved model), rather than the current two, ranging from 4.7&#8243; to 5.5&#8243; in size.The other major rumor reported by the Asian news site is the production of wireless charging module, apparently already ordered from Apple&#8217;s Chinese manufacturer, Foxconn.Apple could be bringing induction charging to the next iPhone, a technology already used in the firm&#8217;s Apple Watch. Other manufacturers, such as Samsung and LG, have offered wireless charging for several years.In any case, Apple fans are expecting a particularly innovative iPhone in 2017 to mark the smartphone&#8217;s 10th birthday in suitable style.Relaxnews
