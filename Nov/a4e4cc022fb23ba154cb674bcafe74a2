Having come to the end of October s Social Development Month we can look back on the initiative of the department of social development that focuses on enhancing access to basic services. Countless citizens are unaware of the various government services at their disposal and the annual Social Development Month aimed to close that gap.The Gauteng provincial government is a caring and people centred government. Gauteng s primary responsibility is to create a better life for all, which requires different spheres of the government to work with increased vigour and accelerated speed to eliminate all the obstacles that stand in the way of our desired goal of a better life for all.At the centre of Gauteng s social transformation is determination to provide social protection to the vulnerable, in particular women and children and eradicate poverty and build social cohesion and social solidarity.The Gauteng provincial government, as part of the national effort to care for our citizens especially the vulnerable like the elderly, children, women and people living with disabilities doubled its efforts in delivering on its mandate.On October 1, we proudly joined the global community in honour our forebears as we embraced the United Nation s General Assembly Resolution as we celebrated the International Day of Older Persons.In celebrating our senior citizens were hosted a prestigious Choral Festival on the September 28, 2016 in Pretoria North, Tshwane. A week later, on October 7 in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni Gauteng Premier David Makhura met with close to 2000 senior citizens to express appreciation for their positive contributions to society.The social security system in South Africa has a long history of fragmentation due to the discriminatory practices of apartheid. The result was inconsistencies in the levels of benefits and quality of service delivery among the different race groups, with the black population suffering the greatest discrimination as beneficiaries of social security.Children also suffered the harsh reality of apartheid where they bore the brunt of political violence, forced removals and high rates of urbanisation. Destruction of the family that resulted partly from the migrant labour system had negative impacts on the social and psychological development of children. The results of these processes included the prevalence of child labour, poverty and homeless.As part of the evolution of developmental services since the adoption of such policies as the White Paper on Reconstruction and Development (1994) and the White Paper for Social Welfare (1997), we are now on track in professionalising community development practice.Based on the provisions of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Gauteng s accelerated social transformation strategy recognises that everyone has the right to an adequate standard of living, including children, the department of social development is providing dignity packs to boys and girls in need.The Gauteng city region early childhood development massification programme is well founded on the National Development Plan Vision 2030 and the vision of the GCR Accelerated Social Transformation Strategy 2030.In improving access to quality ECD, provision of comprehensive ECD services is recognized as an instrument to make investments in health and development of capabilities, to mitigate vulnerabilities and to serve as the building blocks for future resilience. Effective ECD is also critical for ensuring equitable participation of women in the labour market, productive and social life of communities. In line with the priority intervention areas as stipulated in the GCR Accelerated Social Transformation Strategy, the ECD sector reports on the key interventions to accelerate ECD service provision within the GCR.In response to addressing poverty, inequality and unemployment, the department continuously intensifies its efforts to assist poor communities to improve their standards of living. The formation of cooperatives producing a variety of goods and services can help meet this need.Busi Kheswa Busi Kheswa, Gauteng department of social development
