Chancellor Angela Merkel Tuesday lashed populists seeking to exploit Germany&#8217;s refugee influx, but set down a tough line on integration &#8212; including a ban on the veil &#8212; as she launched into election campaign mode. Outlining a strategy to counter populism that has consumed key allies abroad, Merkel vowed there would be no repeat of last year&#8217;s record refugee arrivals.She also stressed it was legitimate for Germany to expect newcomers to integrate, and this included a rejection of the niqab full-face veil.&#8220;The full veil must be banned wherever it is legally possible,&#8221; she told the annual gathering of her centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).Next year&#8217;s polls will &#8220;not be a walk in the park&#8221; as Germany is deeply polarised, Merkel warned, but urged the population to remain &#8220;sceptical about simple answers&#8221;.&#8220;Rarely is it the simple answers that bring progress to our country,&#8221; she said, in a clear reference to the upstart anti-Islam and populist AfD, which Merkel had previously criticised as offering no solutions to problems.&#8211; &#8216;We are the people&#8217; &#8211;Merkel, who has led Germany for 11 years, last month confirmed she would run for a fourth term but acknowledged that the election would be &#8220;more difficult&#8221; than any other she has contested. There have also been questions about whether the 62-year-old has fresh ideas to offer in a world upended by Brexit, the surprise election of Donald Trump and the departure of Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi following a crushing referendum defeat championed by populists.The CDU has suffered setbacks in five consecutive state polls as voters punished Merkel for her liberal refugee policy, with more than a million people seeking asylum in Germany since 2015.Tackling the hot button issue head-on, Merkel vowed that &#8220;a situation like that of summer 2015 can and must not repeat itself&#8221;.She also stressed that each asylum request would be examined carefully, and &#8220;not all can and will stay&#8221; in Germany. Merkel&#8217;s CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU secured a decisive win of 41.5 percent at the last election in 2013 &#8212; its best result since national reunification in 1990, on the back of strong approval for her tough stance on austerity for debt-stricken EU nations.Three years on, there are rumblings of discontent &#8212; even within her own party &#8212; following her September 2015 decision to admit refugees fleeing war in mostly-Muslim nations, a move that deeply polarised Europe&#8217;s biggest economy.Reflecting the mood, party faithful re-elected on Tuesday Merkel as chief for the next two years, but gave her just 89.5 percent &#8212; her second worst score, and the worst since she became chancellor in 2005. Her lowest was in 2004, when she was approved by 88.4 percent.National media had suggested that a score below 90 percent would be a slap in the face.Party members are particularly anxious to halt a haemorrhage of support to the AfD, which has gained a firm footing as a protest platform for disgruntled voters.The upstart party now enjoys around 12 percent support, according to opinion polls. At the last general election it fell short of the five-percent threshold to ensure representation.Hitting out directly at the populists as well as the xenophobic PEGIDA movement, Merkel wrestled their &#8220;we are the people&#8221; rallying cry back, declaring to sustained applause: &#8220;We all get to determine who &#8216;the people&#8217; are &#8212; not just a few, no matter how loud they are.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Disgrace&#8217; &#8211; Beyond domestic issues, Merkel also devoted a large part of her address to crises abroad as she noted that in 2016, &#8220;the world has not become stronger and more stable, but weaker and more unstable&#8221;.She deplored the failure of the international community to alleviate the suffering in Syria&#8217;s besieged city of Aleppo, calling it a &#8220;disgrace&#8221;. Merkel said she was shocked to see tens of thousands of Germans hitting the streets to demonstrate against free trade deals but virtually no protests against the bloodletting in Syria. &#8220;There is something wrong there,&#8221; she said.She also underlined the importance of holding the European Union together, saying Germany will do well &#8220;only when Europe does well too.&#8221;In the face of the mountain of challenges, Merkel urged her delegates: &#8220;You must, you must, help me.&#8221;-AFP
