Hundreds of photos and videos of naked women used as collateral for loans on a Chinese online lending service have been leaked on to the web, highlighting regulatory problems in the fast-growing peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace.A 10GB file exposed the personal details of more than 160 young women who were asked to provide the material to secure money through online lending platform Jiedaibao.Jiedaibao allows lenders to operate anonymously but requires borrowers to reveal their real names when making transactions. Loan amounts and interest rates can be customised to meet the needs of users, often people who have a hard time accessing traditional loans.Not surprisingly, the interest rates typically verge on the extortionate. Interest on the nude loans reached an astonishing 30% a week, according to the Global Times newspaper. Lenders told borrowers that if they failed to repay the loans, their nude photos would be sent to their families and friends, whose information was also required for some transactions. Material in the file put on the web showed some borrowers also promised to repay loans with sexual favours.Jiedaibao said it had tracked down the accounts of several borrowers through photos and ID information circulated online and had frozen the suspected lenders accounts. These nude loans were mainly initiated and completed offline, and Jiedaibao only played the role of a money transfer platform, it said.In November, Alipay, the payment platform of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, was criticised after a set of photos showing female users in seductive poses was leaked on social media.The photos were originally posted in Alipay s newly launched social media feature called Circles, which allows only women to post photos, and had obscene comments from male users.China has nearly 2 600 platforms described as P2P businesses, with transactions valued at around $150bn (R2 trillion) last year.Beijing has been particularly worried about P2P lending. In August it tightened credit regulations by setting a borrowing limit of 1 million yuan (R2m) for individuals. AFP
