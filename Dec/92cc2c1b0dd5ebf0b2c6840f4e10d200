The Constitutional Court yesterday ruled that a Gauteng man who had been embroiled in an inheritance dispute with his late same-sex partner s brother, has the right to benefit from the estate, despite the fact that they were not legally married.Eric Duplan had lived with his same sex partner Cornelius for 12 years when he suddenly died in 2015.When it emerged that Cornelius died intestate his brother, Rasmus Laubscher, became the executor of his estate.However Duplan took the matter to the high court to argue that having been in a permanent live-in relationship with Cornelius he qualified as his spouse.The North Gauteng High Court agreed and ruled in favour of Duplan.Laubscher approached the ConCourt with an application for leave to appeal, arguing that the Civil Union Act, which was passed in 2006 when the two were already together, dictated that only same-sex partners who solemnise and register their union qualify to inherit from each others estate.The Commission for Gender Equality, represented by the Legal Resources Centre was part of the case and argued that finding that Duplan was not entitled to inherit would undermine the rights of same-sex spouses.In a majority judgment written by acting justice Boisie Mbha, the Concourt dismissed Laubscher s application for leave to appeal the high court judgment that Duplan was entitled to benefit from his partner s estate.Mbha said same-sex permanent partners would continue to enjoy intestate succession rights under section 1(1) of Intestate Succession Act, as per the Gory order, until such time that the legislature specifically amends the section. It is not for this court to proscribe protections it previously extended when there is no clear legislative indication that the proscription is mandated. To do so would undermine the aspirations of the human rights culture we seek to cultivate.Whether to provide equality of the graveyard or the vineyard to permanent same-sex partners, is a matter best left to the competencies of the legislature, the judge said.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
