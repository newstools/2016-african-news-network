The dawn of a New Year generally signifies new beginnings and an opportunity to start afresh.It is often at this time of the year that perhaps many look back and bemoan the bad luck that affected them during the year.While it is true to an extent that luck plays a role in how the year pans out, it would be a folly to assume luck is the common denominator in all things that go wrong.From a productivity perspective it is more the lack of planning as opposed to luck that determines the success of any individual, company or institution.Good planning is the bedrock of any productivity improvement. Planning which is more aptly referred to as forethought, is the process of thinking about and organising the activities required to achieve a desired goal.Planning precedes implementation and it is only after a good plan or strategy has been put in place that desirable outcomes can be attained.The common bottlenecks that derail good planning is: A lack of alignment and focus Insufficient access to information Absence of a scorecard to measure No process for accountabilityAs we prepare to enter the new year it is critical for all institutions, companies and individuals to ask themselves: What do we want to attain? Are our goals reasonable? Is there a strategy in place to reach the goals? Do we function as a team? Are all members of the team aware of the strategy and execution thereof?The starting point in ensuring answers to those questions more so in companies or cooperatives is to assess the organisational capability for strategic and performance management.Establishing capacity to manage expectations is a point of departure.Once the levels of capacity have been gauged, next is to look into financial sustainability and general compliance.What will be crucial in planning and implementing strategy is teamwork.The essence of teamwork means all members pull in one direction.MOTHUNYE MOTHIBAMothunye Mothiba is the CEO of Productivity SA
