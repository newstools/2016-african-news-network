In what appears to be an escalation in hostilities between the Hawks and Independent Police Investigative Directorate, the police watchdog body has seized computers and laptops belonging to Limpopo police head of human resources, Gen Hlaudi Morakaladi.Morakaladi is known to be a close associate of Hawks national boss Gen Berning Ntlemeza and top officials LtCol Kgadima, Col Rabayanyana and Aggie Khosa (Moralakadi s PA) at the police s Polokwane headquarters.Ipid is investigating them for corruption over an alleged irregular appointment.Ntlemeza, a former Limpopo deputy provincial police commissioner, has been entangled in a bitter war with Ipid boss Robert McBride who was last week summoned to make a warning statement in connection with a case defeating the ends of justice.A police source claimed yesterday that the Ipid raid was part of a campaign to find incriminating evidence against Ntlemeza including an investigation into his term of office as Limpopo s deputy police commissioner. The computers contain confidential information of all employees and dates back 20 years. There were rumours that those working close to Ntlemeza were going to be purged, the source said.It is alleged that a suspended police officer, who is facing an internal disciplinary hearing, opened the case against the Limpopo officials.The New Age has seen SMSs allegedly sent by the suspended officer to Gen Morakaladi s relative, saying he was going to deal with her (Morakaladi) and Ntlemeza. I have instructed my attorneys to instruct Paul O Sullivan to investigate. He investigated a lot of people and went to jail. I m not investigating Morakaladi, O Sullivan, SIU, Ipid and presidency anti-corruption will investigate. But Ntlemeza I will deal with him till I die, read the SMSs.Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini confirmed the raid. The warrant was executed on Tuesday by members of the Ipid national specialised investigation team. They seized computers from SAPS Limpopo provincial office in a corruption investigation, he said.PETER RAMOTHWALA
