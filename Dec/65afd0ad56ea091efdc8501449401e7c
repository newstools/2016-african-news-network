The eight suspects accused of the rape of a 13-year-old girl in Nyanga recently will spend Christmas behind bars.This comes after the eight young men yesterday made an appearance in the Wynberg Magistrate s Court where the case was postponed to January for a formal bail application.It is alleged that the victim was walking alone in Robert Sobukwe Road, Nyanga in November this year when she was abducted by one of the suspects and taken to a shack where she was repeatedly raped by him and his friends.They kept her at the residence and released her the next day, the state alleges.The eight suspects stand accused of abducting and raping the 13 year old but is has been revealed that there were initially 10 suspects involved in the crime.The two other suspects are yet to be arrested in the Eastern Cape.Court proceedings yesterday saw new defence attorneys for the majority of the accused after their previous attorney, who represented five of the eight accused, withdrew last week.The withdrawal saw a delay in the bail application. The new defence attorneys yesterday agreed to a postponement of the bail application. The case will be postponed until January 18 for a formal bail application. You will all remain in custody, magistrate Moemina Ismail said.Outside court the families of the accused claimed that not all of the arrested suspects were involved in the rape and abduction of the teenager.One family member who did not want to be named said: We can t understand why all of them were arrested. It is not all of them who were involved. Another family member claimed that the police were aware of the fact that not all of the eight accused were involved in the crime but still arrested and kept them in custody. When they arrested the first one, they asked him who was there and they went to arrest everyone, she said. They did not ask who raped the girl and it was not all of the young men that raped her. There are a few that had no involvement in the crime and they don t belong in prison. Nyanga remains a hot spot for incidents of rape involving children.During its time spent in court this week The New Age learnt that in the past week 24 rape cases had been reported in the Nyanga area, of which the majority of victims were children under the age of 10.Most of the suspects appeared in various courts on Monday and were remanded in custody.NADINE FORD-KRITZINGERnadinef@thenewage.co.za
