British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday the needs of businesses adapting to a new relationship with the European Union would be addressed, once a deal for Brexit has been struck.Asked if she was in favour of a transition period to help smooth the process of leaving the EU, May said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve set out one priority that I think we should be making early decisions on in the negotiations, and that&#8217;s in relation to EU citizens living here and UK citizens living in the rest of Europe.&#8220;But as part of the negotiations, we will have to address this question of the practicalities of adjustment to the new relationship once that new relationship has been agreed.&#8221;Last week her finance minister Philip Hammond backed the idea of a transition period to help businesses both in Britain and the EU.-Reuters
