Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo on Saturday called the actions of the opposition, which is blocking access to parliament&#8217;s main hall, &#8220;scandalous&#8221;.Opposition leaders called for days of anti-government protests and pledged to keep blocking parliament after being accused of trying to seize power by a government they say has violated the constitution.&#8220;The move by the opposition to ignite extreme political emotions &#8230; has nothing to do with the actual condition of the country,&#8221; Szydlo said in a televised statement.&#8220;On the contrary, it is due to the helplessness, the frustration of those who have lost the power and who have no idea how to convince Poles of their views.&#8221;-Reuters
