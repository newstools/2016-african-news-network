City of Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga told Tshwane residents that Rome was not built in a day.Msimanga was addressing Tshwane council on his first 100 days in office were he was reporting on his administrations success and failures on Monday.He told council that the Democratic Alliance (DA) promised the people to turn the municipality around, by curbing corruption, job creation and delivering better services. Appreciating that we inherited what can only be described as a mess . With unlawful contracts and costly projects that now have to be completed and some of them undone before completion is in our sights, said Msimanga.He further said that he remained optimistic that the municipality will turn the corner, despite it being in the state it found it self in.Today&#8217;s proceeding included the signing performance agreement contracts of Msimanga&#8217;s Members of Mayoral Committee (MMC), reaffirming their resolve to work towards building a prosperous city.Three months ago he gave his MMC 100 days to turn things around on their respective departments. He told council that as part of the Municipalities effort to bring normality it plans to recruit qualified executives in senior management positions.He alluded that the council was also in the final stages of appointing the city Manager. This comes after former municipal manager Jason Ngobeni resigned two weeks after the local government elections.Ngobeni announced his resignation immediately after the swearing in of the city councillors and its speaker Rachel Mathebe.Msimanga also said the council encountered problems at the beginning they managed to solve all of them, even though most of them where more of labour issues than delivery ones. He also said some of the grievances were not legit but he also acknowledge some as being legit. Some of the issues that were raised were genuine grievance and others were politically motivated arising from the errors which were committed by the previous administration (namely absorption of contract workers, revenue agents, food bank, and big eye at SWA, Vat Alles, and EPWP workers) which in the first instance shouldn&#8217;t have been committed, he added.In addition he said moving forward the city will be concentrating on formalising informal settlements while the construction of top structure pipeline is being attended to through a partnership with the Gauteng provincial government and other stakeholders.-Sipho Jack
