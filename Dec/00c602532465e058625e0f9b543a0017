Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba is set to hold a meeting with Mayor of Johannesburg Herman Mashaba following remarks by Mashaba that illegal foreign nationals in the inner city should leave. &#8220;Minister Gigaba views the comments as unfortunate and will brief the Mayor on government&#8217;s policy and interventions in management of international migration,&#8221; Home Affairs spokesperson Thabo Mokgola said. Mokgola said the meeting had yet to be officially set but would happen in the next few days. &#8220;He [Gigaba] wants to understand basically the rationale behind making those utterances,&#8221; said Mokgola. The African Diaspora Forum (ADF) said while it agreed that criminals should be punished, it was unfortunate that the Johannesburg Mayor had insinuated that all migrants in the city were criminals. Speaking at a briefing on his 100 days in office last week, Mashaba said he would not allow the city to be hijacked by criminals who had come into the country illegally. Mashaba said he had spoken to human rights lawyers and respective embassies to help with illegal migrants in the city. He said the government had opened borders to criminality . They are holding our country to ransom and I am going to be the last South African to allow it, Mashaba said. ADF s Marc Gbaffou said they were concerned that Mashaba made such inflammatory statements especially considering the history of violence against migrants in the city. Criminality does not have a nationality. Migrants, if properly managed and given the right documentation, can contribute significantly to the South African economy, Gbaffou said. Recently the South African Human Rights Commission(SAHRC) found that comments made by Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini in 2015 about foreign nationals, while not amounting to hate speech, could be construed as &#8220;hurtful and harmful.&#8221; Human rights Commissioner Lawrence Mushwana called some of Zwelithini&#8217;s comments &#8220;problematic.&#8221; &#8220;King Zwelinthini suggested that migrants were here to steal jobs and they were criminals that had left their countries of origin with questionable motives and further identified the presence of migrants as one of the social ills that needed to be dealt with,&#8221; said Mushwana. In 2015 an outbreak of attacks on foreign nationals in KZN left at least seven people dead and more than 2000 people displaced. -TNA Reporter
