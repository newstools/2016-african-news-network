Christopher Panayiotou is set to appear in the Port Elizabeth High court on Tuesday for his murder trial.Panayiotou is accused of being the mastermind behind his wife Jayde&#8217;s kidnapping and murder, this according to information given to the police by alleged accomplice turned state witness Luthando Siyoni, who was also Panayiotou s employee.Siyoni was a bouncer at Panayiotou s Infinity nightclub.The state alleges that the plan to kill the school teacher and young wife started as early as 2014 and the recruitment of hitmen happened on Facebook.Jayde disappeared from her home in Port Elizabeth in April last year. Her body was found a day later in an open field in KwaNobuhle township.Meanwhile the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said it still has a strong case against all accused despite the death of the man who pulled the trigger.Sizwe Vumazonke died in hospital after falling into a coma last week, but the NPA says it is in the dark as to the cause of his death.NPA spokesperson Tsepo Ndwalaza said his death changed nothing. You must remember that Vumazonke was the last to be arrested. It was even after the arrest of Christopher Panayiotou. His death will not affect the trial process at all. The other accused are alive and they will go to trial as planned, Ndwalaza said.-TNA Reporter
