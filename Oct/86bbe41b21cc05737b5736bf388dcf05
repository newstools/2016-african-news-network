The family members of 36 patients who died from Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) health care centers called on Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu to resign on Thursday.One of the family members Christine Nxumalo told people who came to support them outside the MEC&#8217;s office at Pixley Seme street in Johannesburg that the bereaved families never received any support from government. After my sister s passing I needed the support and so do other family members who have lost their loved ones. We need to support one another through prayer because the transition and passing of our loved ones was not peaceful, Nxumalo said.She said Mahlangu went to all media houses to tell them her side of the story. Nxumalo said the families were now at the MEC&#8217;s office to give her an opportunity to address them.In September this year Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba said she will investigate the death of the 36 patients.The patients were moved without their families consent to different NGOs in the province after the department decided to cancel Life Health care Esidimeni contract that looked after 2 000 patients in a bid to cut cost.Nxumalo said since the ombudsman started with the investigation, the health department has been focusing on other things. She said Mahlangu was not taking the family members seriously because she knew they were coming.However, Mahlangu&#8217;s spokesperson Steve Mabona said the organisers knew the MEC wont be there because there was a correspondent between families and the office. She indicated that she wont be in a position to attend and she offered to meet with them but they could not because they decided to come on a day the MEC has other commitments, Mabona added.In addition Mahlangu&#8217;s spokesperson said the confirmation between them and the family was that the Head Of Department will receive the memorandum on behalf of the MEC.-Sipho Jack
