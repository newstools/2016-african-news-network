While we are not GAVI eligible as a country, we were able to obtain a multi-million grant from the Treasury Department to roll-out the Free HPV Vaccination Program in 2014 in all our public schools using the integrated school health programme which was launched by President Jacob Zuma in 2012. The set 2014 target was 420000 girls and we managed to reach a total of 92%. A further 356 230 girls were also vaccinated in 2015. The aim of the high-level gathering was to bring together senior country representatives and global experts to exchange best practices and chart out possible road maps to reduce the burden of cancer in mostly in India and beyond.Under the Tobeka Madiba-Zuma Foundation, the first lady said they continued to strive for better care and treatment for those affected by cancer, as we continue to raise awareness .She said the lower and middle income countries can overcome the divide in access to basic healthcare between developing and developed countries and added that a collaborative approach is the only way forward by highlighting the importance of looking at a comprehensive approach towards elimination. This global high-level meeting recognises that the women of our countries continue to experience inequalities, multiple health and socio-economic burdens.Now, let s remember that there was a time when those affected by cancer never could have imagined all these pink ribbons. I don t think they could have imagined people like us placed in unique positions of influence, putting on our pink gloves and ready to fight, MadibaZuma said.The event was organised by Global Health Strategies with several Indian and international partners working on cervical cancer. The outcomes of the gathering are expected to help advance cervical cancer prevention and control efforts in India by raising awareness and initiating conversations between the various relevant government bodies.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
