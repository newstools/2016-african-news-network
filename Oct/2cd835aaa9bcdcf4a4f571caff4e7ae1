Serbia&#8217;s pro-European Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic was moved to a safe location Saturday after an arsenal of weapons, including a rocket-launcher, was found close to his house near Belgrade, which a minister said was &#8220;preparation for assassination&#8221;.Authorities were alerted by passers-by who found the cache in chests in a forest near Vucic&#8217;s family home in Jajinci, south of Belgrade, Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic told reporters.&#8220;There is a rocket launcher, four hand grenades and a large quantity of ammunition for 7.62 mm automatic rifles and 7.9 mm sniper rifles,&#8221; said Stefanovic.&#8220;What is worrying is that these weapons were discovered only a few dozen metres from a turn into the family home of Prime Minister Vucic,&#8221; he said, adding that his retinue would have represented &#8220;a very easy target&#8221;.A former associate of late Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic and once a staunch ultranationalist, Vucic, 46, has since remodelled himself as a pro-EU reformer.Serbia was rocked by the assassination of democratic pro-European prime minister Zoran Djindjic in 2003.Labour and veterans minister Aleksandar Vulin demanded that the security and intelligence services &#8220;give answers (on) who prepared to assassinate the prime minister&#8221;.Deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ivica Dacic called on the authorities to exercise &#8220;particular vigilance, keeping in mind the increase in pressure on our country,&#8221; without elaborating.While taking care to keep on the right side of traditional partner Russia, Vucic has built a reputation in the West as a reliable partner, including by engaging in dialogue on the normalisation of relations with the former Serbian province of Kosovo, which proclaimed independence 2008 but was not recognized by Belgrade.-AFP
