Murder accused Carlos Higuera was sent back to the Sterkfontein Hospital as it emerged in court yesterday that he was not fit to stand trial. The family of the 24 year old was told by the director of public prosecutions that owing to Higuera s condition it had recommended that a competent court make a decision on what would happen to him.Magistrate Albertus Roux ruled that Higuera had to return to Sterkfontein Hospital until a judge made a decision on how long he had to be detained. Higuera is accused of fatally stabbing his friend, Chumisa Nqakula, the son of Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, in Bezuidenhout Valley in October last year.The state said the Nqakula had already been told that the accused, who spent time under observation at hospital, was mentally unwell and could not be prosecuted. Roux explained to Higuera that he would be staying at the psychiatric hospital pending the order from the judge regarding his future.Three psychiatrists from the hospital who examined Higuera found that he was mentally unfit to stand trial. Their diagnosis was accepted by the state and the defence. 701573
