In what looks like a move to extend the CAF Champions League celebrations, Mamelodi Sundowns owner Patrice Motsepe has promised a trophy parade and a big feast.The billionaire mining magnate said yesterday at the OR Tambo International Airport upon the team s arrival that the team will parade the trophy in the Tshwane townships of Soshanguve, Mamelodi, Ga-Rankuwa, Atteridgeville and Hammanskraal among other places.With Sundowns playing Polokwane City in the Telkom Knockout tonight and then facing Cape Town City on Sunday, it is understood that the trophy parade will start on Monday.Motsepe also said that many cows will have to be slaughtered to appease the ancestors and also to give fans who have been standing by Sundowns through thick and thin a massive feast. There will be a huge parade.In our culture, when we are happy, we give thanks to the ancestors. We also thank Jesus Christ and have meat there. We will give the details of where and when this big feast will be.Because we could not take everyone to Egypt, we thank those who went and those who did not will be part of the feast, Motsepe said.Mmasekepe Matsebane|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
