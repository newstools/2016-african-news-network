The crucial issue regarding the ownership and control of companies listed on the JSE and the best way to achieve economic transformation will again come under the spotlight next month during the conference of the Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals (Absip).It won t be the first time this issue comes under scrutiny. It has been raised several times about the number of black-controlled companies listed on the top 100 companies on the JSE, which account for only 3%.However, some commentators doubt if that number is still sitting at 3%, arguing that it could have gone down because many companies might have closed shop because of the ongoing economic hardships.Former executive director for business sustainability and transformation at Sasol, Nolitha Fakude, once said South Africa had not driven hard for economic emancipation as they had done in the political arena.She said in 1994, 85% of the economy was controlled between five companies at the JSE and that, still today, black people were still excluded from the ownership of the economy.Absip, which will be holding its eighth annual conference next month to look at some of these challenges, promises to bring together an group of financial sector professionals who will share insights on economic transformation in their industry and the way forward in a bid to change the picture.This year, the Absip conferenceEconomic Transformation for Social Change will tackle challenges such as inequality, accessibility, the political climate and other socioeconomic issues. The financial services sector will continue to be one of the key drivers of a Maltese economy. Looking ahead to the next decade will be critical for the sector to emerge in a stronger position, Tryphosa Ramano, Absip president said. A Maltese economy is known as an economy that is dependent on foreign trade, especially for manufacturing. The conference will seek to identify key action points that need to be addressed to secure the crucial role that this industry plays in our country not only at the present moment but also in the future, she said.Some of the key speakers expected to engage at the event include investment professionals, chief investment officers, corporate treasurers, pension trustees, institutional investors, banks investment management, government and non-government officials.Joel Netshitenzhe, executive director and board vice-chairperson of the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection, is also expected to play a critical role at the conference.Bernard Sathekge |bernards@thenewage.co.za
