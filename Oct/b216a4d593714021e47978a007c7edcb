French President Francois Hollande on Tuesday urged the US-led coalition backing the offensive against Islamic State jihadists in Mosul to prepare for the aftermath of the city&#8217;s fall, including returning fighters.&#8220;The recapture is not an end in itself. We must already anticipate the consequences of the fall of Mosul,&#8221; he told a meeting of coalition defence chiefs in Paris.US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter and ministers from 12 other countries attended the talks, which come a week after Iraqi forces backed by Kurdish fighters launched a major operation to retake Iraq&#8217;s second-biggest city.&#8220;What is at stake is the political future of the city, the region and Iraq,&#8221; Hollande said, calling for &#8220;all ethnic and religious groups&#8221; to have a say in the future running of the predominantly Sunni city.He also appealed for measures to shield civilians trapped in Mosul by the fighting and for &#8220;vigilance&#8221; faced with the prospect of return foreign jihadists returning home from the Iraqi battlefield.Of the estimated 4,000-5,000 jihadists fighting in Mosul, around 300 are French, according to French officials.Hollande reiterated French warnings about IS fighters in Mosul fleeing across the border to Raqa, the group&#8217;s stronghold in Syria.&#8220;We must clearly identify them,&#8221; he said.The French leader also called on the ministers to set out &#8220;the stages of the next operations&#8221; against IS, namely retaking Raqa.&#8220;If Mosul falls, Raqa will be Daesh&#8217;s last bastion,&#8221; he said, using another name for IS, which is also known by the acronyms of ISIS or ISIL.&#8220;We must see to it that Daesh is destroyed and eradicated everywhere.&#8221;-AFP
