Tokyo nursed a giant pumpkin-sized hangover Monday after a weekend of Halloween revelry which saw blood-spattered ghouls, fluffy animals and fake presidential candidates cut loose.For the normally reserved Japanese, the macabre celebration of the dead is an excuse to slip on a wacky costume and let their hair down at boozy parties decorated with tombstones, skeletons and spiders.&#8220;We got into Halloween when our children started to go to kindergarten,&#8221; Eriko Yoshino told AFP, dressed as the Alice in Wonderland character Tweedledum at a kids parade.&#8220;The children love it and it&#8217;s fun to wear fancy dress and cook pumpkin dishes,&#8221; she added, confiding: &#8220;Nothing too fancy &#8212; something I can pop in the microwave.&#8221;With Halloween falling on a Monday this year, major weekend parades in Tokyo and Kawasaki, south of the capital, drew some 250,000 party-goers while Tokyo Disneyland also enjoyed a bumper two days.Halloween is a billion-dollar industry in Japan with an estimated 20 million people nationwide getting into the grisly spirit.Shops and bars are decked out with pumpkins and jack-o&#8217;-lanterns, while restaurants and convenience stores offer pumpkin-flavoured drinks and desserts.&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why I&#8217;ve flown in,&#8221; said a young reveller dressed as a rooster and identifying himself only as Chicken Shota.&#8220;Too many chickens are being gobbled up around the world,&#8221; he added, perched dexterously on a hoverboard outside a pub.&#8220;My message for people is to stop persecuting chickens.&#8221;Dastardly pirates swigging from beer cans caroused with skimpily clad fairies and Harry Potter hexed a crooning Elvis as police battled to control heaving crowds during a long Saturday fright night at Shibuya&#8217;s scramble crossing.&#8211; &#8216;Donald&#8217;s not so bad&#8217; &#8211;&#8220;In the spirit of Halloween I&#8217;ve come to offer an olive branch to Donald,&#8221; said one reveller in a rubber Hillary Clinton mask as she, or he, put a friendly arm around a Donald Trump lookalike. &#8220;He&#8217;s not so bad.&#8221;Less politically motivated trick-or-treaters gathered in Tokyo&#8217;s trendy Shimokitazawa neighbourhood, competing for sweets being handed out by shop owners.&#8220;I love Halloween,&#8221; said Haruka Ebino, aged four and a half, her face barely visible beneath a furry dinosaur costume.Cradled by her father, she added with a gap-toothed grin: &#8220;My Godzilla suit is nice and warm.&#8221;Among Ebino&#8217;s pint-sized friends were stormtroopers, ninja turtles and a team of ghostbusters.But the freaks came out at night as Ebino and her cohorts were safely tucked up in bed.&#8220;Drink this,&#8221; drooled a vampire bartender, fake blood dribbling from his chin as he offered a smouldering concoction served in a test tube. &#8220;You will turn into Dracula.&#8221;At the same Halloween bash, flesh-eating zombie nurses squirted blood-red alcohol shots into the mouths of club-goers, who would all be back at their desks on Monday morning dressed more sensibly.&#8220;Japanese people love dressing up,&#8221; said 29-year-old Mitsuo Kaneshiro with a swish of his Batman cape.&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be able to escape your daily life now and again. I&#8217;ll be back in the office in a suit and tie tomorrow.&#8221;-AFP
