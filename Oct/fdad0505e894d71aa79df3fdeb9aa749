The name Lars Veldwijk may not ring a bell with the South African football public but this could well be the man who solves the goal-scoring conundrum for Bafana Bafana.That s the belief, and wish, of coach Shakes Mashaba, who yesterday named the Dutch-born striker in his squad for the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Senegal.Veldwijk, described by Mashaba as a big boy who can hold on to the ball and also score goals, is based in Belgium where he plays for KV Kortrijk.Mashaba said he had been monitoring the 25-year-old marksman since his days with English Championship side Nottingham Forrest and during his loan spell at Dutch club Zwolle.Even though he didn t quite set the scene alight in the English league, where he scored once in 17 matches, Veldwijk featured prominently for Zwolle by netting 14 goals in 33 appearances last season.Even though he was not born in South Africa, Veldwijk is eligible to play for Bafana through his South African-born father. We ve been monitoring Lars when he was still with Nottingham, Mashaba said. A good striker, big boy, busy in the box, who can hold and score as well. Veldwijk cut his teeth at Dutch side FC Volendam before moving to FCUtrecht. He also played for Dordrecht and Excelsior before joining Nottingham Forest.Veldwijk comes as a replacement for Thamsanqa Gabuza, the underperforming Orlando Pirates striker, who has been dropped. A win against Senegal is crucial because it will see us at the top of the group this early and everything will be in our hands going forward, Mashaba said.Kgomotso Sethushakgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
