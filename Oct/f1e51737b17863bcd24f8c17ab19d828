Tensions were high yesterday after former Wits SRC leader Shaeera Kalla was allegedly shot multiple times with rubber bullets by the police after a clash between law enforcement officials and protesting students, who apparently disrupted classes.The Wits SRC said Kalla was shot with at least nine bullets while trying to negotiate with the police.A student who gave an eyewitness account of what happened told The Daily Vox that Kalla had been trying to pacify students while trying to negotiate with the police when she was showered in a hail of bullets.SRC secretary Fasiha Hassan said the violence from the police was unwarranted as the protesting students had no form of weaponry but were still shot at very close range.Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said she could not confirm the name of the injured student or how many wounds she had sustained. I can confirm, though, that a student was shot and treated by the campus health and wellness centre. She was later taken to hospital. There were four others who were treated there and released. There was one student with a dislocated knee who was also taken to hospital, Patel said.She said the protesting group disrupted classes at the west campus and the medical school. A chemical engineering test was apparently disrupted.Meanwhile, hundreds of students from various institutions in Pretoria took the fight for free education to the Union Buildings yesterday, joined by high school students from across Pretoria.The students called for the release of the more than 500 students who were arrested across the country since the start of the fees protests. We want the release of all 500 students now. We are not backing down on our demands for free education and we are not backing down on the demand for full insourcing of all workers in all universities and colleges, student leader Vusi Mahlangu said.LILLIAN SELAPISA
