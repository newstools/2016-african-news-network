&nbsp;With six weeks to go to the end of the tax season, the SA Revenue Service (SARS) has already received 4 million income tax returns.The figure includes returns received for previous years of assessment. SARS said that more than 1.4 million returns were submitted via eFiling, while more than 1.5 million returns were submitted electronically at a SARS branch.SARS has encouraged taxpayers to submit their tax returns via eFiling to avoid standing in long queues at SARS branches. Taxpayers who need guidance when filing their returns via eFiling can use Help-You-eFile, an online service which connects taxpayers to a SARS agent telephonically in order to navigate eFiling together.Meanwhile the SARS eFiling mobisite and SARS eFiling App is available for techno-savvy taxpayers. The SARS eFiling mobisite has also been enhanced to be made more user-friendly and accommodating for blind and partiallysighted taxpayers.SARS has warned taxpayers to be on the lookout for fraud and phishing scams where criminals try to gain access to their banking details by sending emails which pretend to be from SARS. SARS has tightened its controls on the tax return process in light of the challenges encountered towards possible tax fraud.Taxpayers are urged to take ownership of their tax affairs even if they are making use of a registered tax practitioner or intermediary. This includes protecting their personal details and the credentials used on electronic devices.Taxpayers are also urged to always authenticate communication from SARS with the contact centre or at their nearest branch.THELMA NGOMA |thelman@thenewage.co.za
