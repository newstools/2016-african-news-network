THE latest internet sensation, five-year old Jake Amo from Uganda has not only captured the hearts of social media users for his picture that went viral, he has also garnered global backing for funding.The famous picture, in which the little boy is captured earnestly drawing on a piece of paper, was captured by Ugandan-born artist Solomon Adufah. The picture, taken in August 2015, has since been turned into a number of memes by social media users to draw laughs about everything from signing a new job contract to battling with a hard exam question.A crowdfunding campaign for Jake which was started this week with the aim of raising $20000 (R270000) is fast gaining momentum and had raised R18 623 in the first 24 hours. The campaign is meant to support Jake and many other children in the village of Asempanaye in Ghana , from where Jake hails. According to Udufah, the image of Jake was part of the Homeland Series outreach programme he held in Ghana.Lamenting that Jake s image was used as a source of mockery, Udufah said: Jake was one of the children I taught in Ghana. He was always gentle and quiet. Ever present in class and was eager to learn every day. I wish the positive aspect of this image will go viral instead of how it s being now portrayed.I understand it s something I can t control. I can only continue to positively impact the lives of people with my talent and purpose. The artist said he was now trying to use the image s popularity for good by starting a fundraising campaign for Jake and his classmates. My ultimate goal is to one day help build an art school in Ghana, he told Africa Check. Meanwhile, a fight between friends in Durban that was caught on camera continues to cause waves on the internet. The video resulted in a social media frenzy with the trend #WarrapenKeegan a phrase that is heard repeatedly in the video.
