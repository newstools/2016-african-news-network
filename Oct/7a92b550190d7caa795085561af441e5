Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has heaped praise on Midfielder Khama Billiat and Themba Zwane for their positive contribution in the second half of the Telkom KnockOut last-16 clash against Polokwane City at the Lucas Moripe stadium on Thursday evening. Khama and Zwane are game changers. Once you have them, they know our angles and know how we play the passing. You could see the goal we scored. You could see even in the last one we found each other nice but is because they have been around with us, said Mosimane. Mosimane has admitted that his team struggled to get the passing right, but was quick to point out the cause of the lack of fluidity in the team, saying the new players are still trying to find out how the team plays. We were little bit lethargic in the first half. We couldn&#8217;t find our feet, Mosimane said. We couldn t get the passing right. But you must understand I&#8217;m trying my best to incorporate the new players. Vilakazi, Zakri, Morena and when you have four of them on the new team especially on the attack we don t get our free flow, concluded Mosimane. -Ntsako Mashaba
