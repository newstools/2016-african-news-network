The R101 road in Hammanskraal has now been open for traffic following a taxi drivers protest.Earlier on Tuesday, two taxi associations closed off the roads allegedly over a route dispute, resulting in all roads coming in and outside Hammanskraal being closed off.Tshwane metro police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba said the stand off between the two associations started in the early hours of the morning and continued up until 10am. I can now confirm that all roads that were closed are now open. We managed to persuade the two associations to go back to the table and sort out their issues, Mahamba added.-Sipho Jack
