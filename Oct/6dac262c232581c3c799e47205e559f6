Israel&#8217;s Maccabi Tel Aviv has fired head coach Erez Edelstein after the team began its Euroleague basketball season with two straight losses, the team announced.Maccabi said in a statement late Saturday that Edelstein, who was only hired in June and also coaches the Israeli national team, will be replaced by assistant coach Rami Hadar.The team provided few details on the change, but signalled disagreement on the direction of the club.&#8220;After a late-night meeting between team owners, management and Erez Edelstein, it was decided to end Edelstein&#8217;s tenure as head coach due to incompatibility between the two sides,&#8221; the statement said.Maccabi has traditionally been Israel&#8217;s powerhouse basketball team, but struggled last season and stumbled to an 0-2 start in Euroleague play this year.It is however currently in first place in Israeli premier league play at 3-0.Edelstein, 55 and an Israeli national, has coached a number of Israeli clubs and has been national team coach since 2014.Hadar has previously served as head coach for Israel&#8217;s Maccabi Haifa.Maccabi Tel Aviv won the 2014 Euroleague title, with then head coach David Blatt moving on to the NBA to coach the Cleveland Cavaliers.Blatt was fired by the Cavaliers midway through last season, with a rift between him and superstar LeBron James seen as contributing to his dismissal. Cleveland went on to win the NBA title.-AFP
