Recently appointed Thabong station commander Brig Nikiwe Hoaeane says she found it in a good state and will focus on improving policing in the area.Hoaeane, who took over on September 1, is a highly experienced police officer.She said she would focus on getting the police involved in community upliftment projects and recently handed over blankets to elderly citizens in Sector 2, which includes Jerusalem Park, Mshengoville and 2010 village.More than 40 elderly citizens gathered at a local church where she donated blankets.Upon her appointment, Hoaeane issued a stern warning to members of the public not to take the law into their own hands after 24-year-old Thabo Maxwell Mokoena was killed in what appeared to be mob justice.She said mob justice was against the law because the South African police are trained and competent to prevent, combat and investigate crime. They take mob justice cases seriously and perpetrators will be arrested and criminally prosecuted.She also intends to continue educating members of the public on how to report crime and what to do when they catch a suspect.Her policing career started in 1994 after placement as a student constable at Pretoria Police Training College and she never looked back.She said on completion of her basic police training she was placed at Mhluzi where she worked as a constable in visible policing.Hoaeane also flexed her policing muscle in the detective and community service centre in crime prevention in Orange Farm and De Deur before working in the Gauteng provincial commissioner s office. I also worked as a station commander at Sharpeville police station before taking a station commander s post in Thabong. I went through all the ranks because of mercy and blessings from our mighty God who made all things possible for me, He guided me through my challenging policing career, Hoaeane said.She believes that with the experience she gained during her 22 years of service, the Thabong community will receive the services that the police are mandated to provide. The standard of Thabong is very high and my intention is to maintain this standard and keep Thabong shining brightly. This will be done through working together with the community and all external stakeholders. Becker Semelabeckers@thenewage.co.za
