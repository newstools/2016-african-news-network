More than 400 people have been assisted in Parys and Wesselsbron since the labour department s outreach campaign this week.Yesterday, labour employees were in Marquard, a rural town in the eastern Free State.Labour spokesperson Josial Ramokoena said their staff processed claims, finalising and facilitating payments on the spot.He said they were also finalising and facilitating their payments on the spot for Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) and Compensation Fund benefits. We will continue with this on Friday (today) in Botshabelo and we will be at H1 Community Hall from 9am to 5pm. The main objective of the campaign is to take services closer to the people and provide a one-stop shop of all services we offer, Ramokoena said.He said the campaign was spearheaded by the Compensation Fund but hosted in conjunction with other branches of their labour sectors such as the inspection and enforcement services, and public employment services as well as the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Sixty-two clients received assistance on compensation related matters; eight injured on duty cases were assessed and confirmed as such while two unreported fatalities were identified with one having been registered after labour inspectors intervention to get the required documentation from the employer. A total of 104 cases were recorded for UIF related matters, 22 applications were approved and are to be processed by the paymasters, Ramokoena said.He said 24 non-compliance cases were identified and recorded for further investigation while two cases were followed up immediately by labour inspectors and 235 CVs were received from job seekers for capturing on their departmental database and possible placement. No less than 30 officials of the department from different units inclusive of decision makers within the department are physically attending to clients during the visits to different towns. Service requirements from clients ranged from injury on duty, occupational diseases or fatality claims as well as unemployment insurance claims, Ramokoena said.He said complainants were assisted and decisions to approve or decline such claims, provided all the required documentation was available, were made right on the spot. Work seekers are encouraged to bring along their CVs and ID documents to be registered on the database of the department of labour for possible placement as and when job opportunities become available.
