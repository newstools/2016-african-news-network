WITS University has developed a comprehensive security plan to ensure final examinations commence on Thursday.The university completed its academic programme last week. We will once again need the assistance of all academics, professional and administrative staff and students to see the examination period through without incident, Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said. We have developed comprehensive security plans for the examinations, all of which will be written with the appropriate security protocols in place. She said all students, even if they had outstanding fees, would be allowed to write exams. Attendance at lectures consistently improved since the decision to resume the academic programme, even though we experienced significant disruptions.Only a small proportion of lectures and tests were disrupted, she said. The Wits University council called on President Jacob Zuma to intervene in the unrest at universities. We note the efforts of the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Blade Nzimande, in trying to address this crisis, Wits council member Cas Coovadia said. However, there is not sufficient appreciation of the fact that this is a national crisis of significant proportions and therefore requires the president and his office to lead resolutions. Coovadia said the inclusion of the national Treasury in the ministerial task team was an important step in the right direction.However, Zuma should be at the forefront of exploring options for the sustainable funding of higher education. The Wits council calls on President Jacob Zuma to urgently do the following: establish a multidisciplinary, deliberative gathering that will explore sustainable funding options, which must ensure no student who qualifies is excluded for financial reasons, ensure the gathering establishes clear time frames and milestones and commit necessary resources and capacity to ensure the necessary work is undertaken expeditiously, Zuma s spokesperson, Bongani Ngqulunga, was unavailable for comment.&#8211;BATANDWA MALINGO
