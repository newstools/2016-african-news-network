Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa(Prasa) is set to unveil its mock-up train at the Pretoria Station Precinct on Wednesday.The state-of-arts safety and comfort train adopted internationally, will have special features of air conditioners, smoker detectors, emergency calling buttons and on-board CCTV to ensure the safety of commuters.The much anticipated world-class train will carry 1344 passengers per 6-car train.With Brazil expected to produced 20 trains, it has already manufactured approximately 11 which are in South Africa. Meanwhile, the construction of the the 580 car trains are underway in Ekurhuleni.&#8220;The single coach mock-up train has been placed at Pretoria Station precinct which was the most suitable area structurally to hold the coach with enough space also to transport the coach on the road without the need to demolish existing structures,&#8221; said Prasa in a statement.The new trains are expected to start running at the first deployment corridor between Pienaarspoort and Koedoespoort in Pretoria.PRASA added that it will be purchasing 3 600 vehicles of six car train sets which will be delivered over the next 10 years.The trains went for testing earlier this year and will replace the current trains which have been operating for years.&#8220;For the next 10 to 15 years, Prasa will continue to run the current trains and will gradually phase-out the current trains as the Modernisation Programme progresses to different areas,&#8221; said PrasaFurthermore, the new trains are part of government&#8217;s investment into the development of a integrated public transport system for the country.In August, Prasa revealed that it has been given R172bn, by government, to improve aging train infrastructure over the next 20 years in order to provide an overall better service. We are experiencing serious service deficiencies because of the kind of assets we have, the last trains we bought was during the 1980 s, Prasa acting CEO Collins Letsoalo said. The Prasa system is bulking under pressure as it wasn t designed to cater for a population of 53 million people, continued Lestoalo. We have to intensify our maintenance plan in order to look after old trains before the new ones arrive. It s unacceptable that traveling time in trains can take up to six hours, said Lestoalo.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale&#8211;Additional reporting Siphiwe Mchunu
