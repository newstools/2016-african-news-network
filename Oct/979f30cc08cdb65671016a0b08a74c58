Hillary Clinton took time off from storming the campaign trail in the key state of Florida Tuesday to take in a pre-birthday concert by pop icon Adele.Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said the award-winning British singer, who can&#8217;t vote in the United States, is &#8220;100 percent for Hillary Clinton,&#8221; adding: &#8220;I love her. She&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;Merrill says Adele told the audience that while she is British, &#8220;what happens in America affects me too.&#8221;Clinton turns 69 on Wednesday.Reporters were not allowed to join Clinton for her concert treat &#8212; so we don&#8217;t yet know whether the White House hopeful belted out a few of her Adele favorites in the dark.On a possibly wackier note, the former top US diplomat and ex-senator hours earlier appeared on a Spanish-language entertainment show, where she shared her favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies.Hosts of the Univision show &#8220;El gordo y la flaca,&#8221; gave Clinton a bottle of tequila to celebrate the last year of her sixties.-AFP
