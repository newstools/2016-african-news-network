This week we mark the 99th birthday of the late ANC president and stalwart Oliver Tambo, who is universally hailed as an outstanding example of a servant of the people and our country.OR Tambo worked selflessly and tirelessly to build and sustain unity of purpose in our struggle for freedom.There is so much that young leaders across our continent and the world can learn from Tambo and emulate his exemplary life of leadership and service, that synonymous to a complete guide book on key political skills including how to mobilise, organize, lobby and advocate for a just and common cause.ANC branches must urgently learn to master such basic political skills if they were to play any effective opposition roles within local communities and in municipal councils. The pursuit of any developmental agenda equally require these basic skills.Tambo died in April 1993 just before the birth of the democracy he championed was ushered in 1994. Speaking at Tambo s funeral, Nelson Mandela, who succeeded Tambo as ANC president in 1991, described him as a great giant who strode the globe like a colossus and a brother who set himself a task which only the brave would dare .Tambo, like both Mandela and Walter Sisulu, undoubtedly epitomised unity of purpose within the ANC and between the ANC and society, in the same way they did across the African continent, and between Africa and the progressive political world.It is almost impossible to speak about Tambo without mentioning Mandela, in the same way you cannot refer or even think about both Tambo and Mandela, arguably without crediting Sisulu for his unique role in sustaining their shared unity of purpose.The inseparable political master trio shared the ideals of freedom and democracy defining our country, and they mobilised successive generations from the decade of the 40s and arguably successive decades to date. Many more people quotes their ideas.Tambo, like both Mandela and Sisulu, without excluding all others leaders and activists who shaped them or worked closely with and supported them, from both within the ANC and its allies and outside it, truly lived up to Frantz Fanon s charge that each generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfil it, or betray it .Tambo indeed fulfilled the mission of uniting the ANC. It is sad that today, just over twenty years after ushering freedom and democracy, many more members and leaders of the ANC and its allies are doing everything to divide it.Some will never miss and an opportunity to insult the ANC president, while others would wish for the ANC to die.We all seem to forget the fundamental lesson OR Tambo taught us, that our country could always be united as long as the ANC itself is united, also that a divided ANC is not in the interest of building a united nation, in the same way as attacking the ANC leadership and demobilising ANC members is suicidal to the cause of transforming our nation.The most difficult task of them all facing ANC leaders and members today is to be inspired by Tambo in the manner he worked selflessly and tirelessly, but more than Tambo did throughout three decades, leaders and members of the ANC must above all tempting attractions of state power seek to unite the ANC itself and thereby uniting all the people of our country.Tambo himself faced same tasks, which he ably discharged above distinction, albeit under more difficult and more different conditions.He truly epitomised unity for all, hence it was befitting as Mandela proclaimed at his funeral as it remains relevant to proclaim today, that Oliver Tambo has not died; because the ideals for which he sacrificed his life can never die .Bennitto MotitsweBennitto Motitswe is a writer and commentator
