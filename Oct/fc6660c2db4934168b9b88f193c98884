The backlash against African National Congress Parliamentary Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu&#8217;s utterances that party leadership should step down continued on Monday with the Mpumalanga ANC saying it is upset with his comments.&#8220;The ANC is perturbed by calls from Mthembu who in the midst of a quiet weekend decided to take it upon himself to speak unmandated and out of turn, about the resignation of the president and the NEC.&#8221;&#8220;It is facetious for any member, individual or organisation to call for the removal of the president or the NEC for that matter, by any other means than a conference of the ANC,&#8221; the ANC in Mpumalanga said in a statement.The rebuke against Mthembu comes against a colleague who served as the MEC for Transport in Mpumalanga from 1997 to 1999.Mthembu has charged that in view of the charges facing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, the call to have the entire leadership of the ANC resign should be re-discussed.Mthembu&#8217;s remarks received a backlash by members of the party who accused him of causing further divisions in the party by not properly addressing matters within party structures.ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa on Monday said Mthembu&#8217;s outburst was an act of ill-discipline.Speaking to ANN7 Kodwa said that there was plenty of opportunity provided to members to vent their opinions within the ambit of the party.&#8220;This is ill-discipline because in the organisation we have been calling for members particularly leaders as there are adequate platforms to express their personal views and what we find regrettable is when people express their views outside the organisation because it does not help,&#8221; Kodwa said.According to Kodwa, Mthembu will continue to lead the ANC in Parliament despite his comments saying the caucus was made up of more than just an individual.Mthembu alleged that instruments of the state were used to prosecute an ANC minister. When you see these things being done by a democratic state, your heart jumps. We are not only equal to the apartheid state, we are worse. They never treated their Ministers like this, Mthembu said.The ANC Veterans and the ANC Youth League are also amongst those who have lambasted Mthembu for his comments also urging him to resign from his position as Chief Whip.-TNA Reporter
