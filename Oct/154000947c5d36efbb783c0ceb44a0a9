The feasibility of relocating Parliament from Cape Town to Pretoria is currently being assessed by a seven department inter-ministerial task team which is set to make recommendations to Parliament.This was revealed by President Jacob Zuma who was responding to questions in the National Council of Provinces on Tuesday.According to Zuma: &#8220;In preparation for engagement with Parliament, the Department of Public Works has been tasked by cabinet to further investigate the merits of relocation and an inter-departmental task team comprising departments that contribute to the optimal functioning of Parliament was constituted.&#8221;The President revealed that National Treasury is looking at the financial and budgetary implications of a possible relocation while the Department of Justice is looking at the legislative requirements and processes.The Department of Public Service and Administration is looking at the administrative and human capital implications and the Department of transport is looking into transport and logistic implications.The Police service is looking into the safety and security implications while department of labour is looking into human resource implications.&#8220;Department of Public Works as the custodian of public infrastructure and a accommodation service department to Parliament is also engaging Parliament on a review of previous needs analysis and the space audit conducted in 2006 and 2007,&#8221; Zuma said.President Zuma told parliamentarians that an examination of the costs of upgrading existing Parliament precincts to meet current space requirements and those of constructing a new precinct in Parliament in Pretoria is also being done.During his 2016 State of the Nation Address(SONA), Zuma said a lot of money would be saved if the country reconsidered the maintenance of two capitals.Zuma on Tuesday said preliminary feasibility studies appear to corroborate his assessment.&#8220;The preliminary assessments point to that in the long term the cost to relocate the legislative authority from Cape Town to Pretoria will be significantly less than maintaining the status quo,&#8221; Zuma said.However the potential move if approved by Parliament could also have negative economic effects particularly for the city of Cape Town which would include a loss of income for the city as well as a loss of jobs and business providing services to Parliament.Parliamentarians asked for possible time frames for the relocation, Zuma replied that it was currently not possible to provide a time until the decision was before Parliament.&#8220;As members of Parliament we should be saying here is a matter, when are we discussing it and taking a decision. Time frames can only be made when there is a decision, then we know we are implementing and these are the time frames,&#8221; Zuma said.Sphiwe Mchunu
