Disruption of classes, blocking of entrances or exits, interfering with traffic flow, putting up barricades that prevent people from conducting normal business or attending classes, and any form of intimidation whether physical or verbal is unlawful. The University was scheduled to resume academic classes after a two-week shut down on Tuesday.Students across the country&#8217;s universities are adamant that ongoing protest will not calm until their demands are met, which include scrapping of student debts and fee increments and the call for fee free education for 2017.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
