England spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid removed Bangladesh&#8217;s opening pair as the visitors pushed for victory Sunday in the first Test, after setting the hosts a target of 286 runs.With plenty of time and wickets in hand, Bangladesh also fancy their chances after reaching 86-2 at lunch on the fourth day and needing another 200 runs for their maiden Test victory over England.In an evenly poised Test in Chittagong, Rashid got Imrul Kayes for 43 in the penultimate over before the break, to bolster confidence in the English camp.Kayes, who hit six fours in his 61-ball innings, looked well settled until he misjudged a sweep shot to get a top edge which flew to Joe Root at slip.It also ended his 46-run second wicket stand with Mominul Haque, who remained unbeaten on 19 at the interval alongside Mahmudullah, who was four not out.Moeen handed England their first breakthrough, when he removed Tamim Iqbal for nine as Gary Ballance took the catch at forward short leg.Just one ball earlier, Tamim survived a review after Root took a catch that initially hit the body of a tumbling Ben Stokes at slip. The replay indicted there was no bat or glove involved.England were earlier all out for 240 in their second innings in the fifth over of the morning, adding 12 runs to their overnight tally of 228-8.Bangladesh&#8217;s left-arm spinner Taijul Islam trapped Gareth Batty leg before off his second ball after Stuart Broad was run out on his overnight score of 10.Chris Woakes was unbeaten on 19.The second and final Test of the series will start in Dhaka on October 28.-AFP
