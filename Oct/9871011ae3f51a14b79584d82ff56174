Highlands Park and Chippa United look to advance the quarter finals when the two sides clash on Friday .It will be the first game that Gordon Igesund takes charge after being appointed earlier this week. And Chippa will be looking to go one better after failing to get to the final of the MTN8, as they fell to Champions Mamelodi Sundowns in the semi-final.Igesund said Chippa are a very dangerous team and believes that coach Dan Malesela has done a fantastic job. Telkom and in any cup competition its only 4 or 5 games your in the final, and its an opportunity. Sometimes its very difficult to win trophies, may coaches go their whole careers without winning anything, Igesund said.The coach will divert from making drastic changes and stresses the importance of making sure the team understands what he wants to do. It&#8217;s always difficult for a team that comes from the first division to the Premier league because it takes them a little bit of time to settle down &#8230;and the pace of the game, the championship winning coach said.Siyabonga Ngubane told the club&#8217;s website that his team-mates are focused on the game against Highlands Park. Highlands Park will be a different ball game. Cup games are different, but we must focus on our preparations,&#8221; the former Mamelodi Sundowns and University of Pretoria player said. I came here to continue with my development as a player and I think I am on the right track. Hopefully we can put the disappointment of losing the game against Arrows behind and focus on the next game. Our objectives going to this game remain the same; to compete for every trophy on offer and fight for the badge, a determined Ngubane concluded.The match will be played at the Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa with kick off at 8pm , Friday 21 October 2016 .
