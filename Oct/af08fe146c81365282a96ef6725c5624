The man accused of killing Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and Charles Nqakula&#8217;s son is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Thursday.Carlos Higuera, 24, is accused of fatally stabbing Chumani Nqakula in Bezuidenhout Valley.Chumani Nqakula was stabbed in the upper body in November last year while his mother was overseas for work.Last week Tuesday, the accused was declared mentally unfit to stand trial.Prosecutors in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court told magistrate Albertus Roux that three psychiatrists had concluded that Higuera suffered from a mental illness.The matter has now been handed over to the director of the NPA in south Gauteng for a final decision.Higuera s father George, testified that his son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and that his son s medication changed just days before the incident.He also said that Carlos started acting strange after the death of his mother in 2010.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has forgiven the man who stabbed her son.Speaking to the SABC on Wednesday, Mapisa-Nqakula said though she was saddened by the ruling she sympathised with Higuera s family. You can t just say he is unfit to stand trial and that the national director of Public Prosecution will decide on whether to continue with the trial&#8230;I will heal in time but I feel pain for his family, Mapisa-Nqakula said.-TNA Reporter
