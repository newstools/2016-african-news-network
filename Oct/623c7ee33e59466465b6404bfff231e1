A roadside bombing killed two Egyptian policemen on Friday in the north of the Sinai Peninsula, where Islamic State group jihadists are waging a fierce insurgency, the interior ministry said.The bomb targeted a truck distributing water to police checkpoints on a highway leading to El-Arish, the capital of north Sinai, the ministry said in a statement.The explosion also wounded a police conscript, it added.Jihadists have killed hundreds of soldiers and police since the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013.They pledged allegiance to IS more than a year later, and their attacks have persisted despite a sweeping military campaign in the peninsula which borders Israel and the Gaza Strip.The jihadists have also targeted foreigners, claiming the bombing in 2015 of a Russian airliner carrying tourists home from a Sinai resort. All 224 people on board were killed.-AFP
