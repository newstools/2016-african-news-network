White House rivals Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump staged dueling rallies Tuesday in crucial battleground Florida, with the Republican billionaire zeroing in on the Obamacare health overhaul as a job-killing, wallet-busting &#8220;monster.&#8221;With just two weeks before the November 8 election, polls showed Democrat Clinton &#8212; who is vying to become America&#8217;s first female president &#8212; dominating nationally and looking for a resounding mandate to govern the bitterly divided country.Early voting began in Florida on Monday, an urgent reminder that candidates have little time left to make their case in the country&#8217;s third most populous state, one with a wide mix of constituencies, including numerous retirees, Latinos and Bible Belt whites.The Republican nominee, determined to ride out the controversies hobbling his campaign, made a pitch to Florida&#8217;s elderly voters by assailing a sharp rise in health insurance premiums expected next year under President Barack Obama&#8217;s signature health care reform.&#8220;It&#8217;s just blowing up,&#8221; the 70-year-old real estate mogul said at a golf course he owns in Doral, Florida, vowing to &#8220;repeal and replace&#8221; Obamacare if elected.&#8220;You will have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost and it&#8217;s going to be so easy,&#8221; Trump promised a rally in Sanford, Florida a few hours later.At a third stop, in Tallahassee, he assailed the &#8220;stupid&#8221; government officials &#8220;who rammed this monster down our throats.&#8221;&#8220;Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way that our system is rigged, believe me,&#8221; Trump said, and Clinton &#8220;wants to keep it.&#8221;Poll averages show that the former secretary of state, who turns 69 Wednesday, is ahead in Florida by 3.1 percentage points, and nationally by 5.4 points, according to RealClearPolitics.&#8211; &#8216;Bigger than me&#8217; &#8211;Rallying supporters at a college in southern Broward County near Fort Lauderdale, Clinton urged Floridians to help propel her to the White House by getting out and voting &#8220;right now.&#8221;&#8220;This is bigger than me. It&#8217;s bigger than any of us. It&#8217;s even bigger than Donald Trump if you can believe it,&#8221; she told the cheering crowd.Obama &#8212; who will campaign for Clinton Friday in Florida &#8212; has said he wants an overwhelming Democratic victory in order to send the message that Americans reject Trump&#8217;s divisive rhetoric.Clinton&#8217;s communications director Jennifer Palmieri made clear what a key piece of the election puzzle Florida represents for Democrats.&#8220;We don&#8217;t plan to lose Florida. It is the biggest prize,&#8221; she told reporters.No one has forgotten that the 2000 presidential election hinged on Florida, where a virtual tie was decided in favor of George W. Bush by the US Supreme Court.&#8211; Obama &#8216;into the act&#8217; &#8211;Earlier, Trump acknowledged that the White House will likely elude him if he doesn&#8217;t win Florida and its 29 electoral votes.&#8220;I think that&#8217;s probably true,&#8221; he told Fox News. &#8220;I believe Florida is must-win. I think we&#8217;re winning it, think we&#8217;re winning it big.&#8221;On the stump in Sanford, Trump pointed to what he called &#8220;record&#8221; lines of early voters in Florida &#8212; many, he said, sporting Trump hats and buttons &#8212; as a hopeful sign.He also took direct aim at Obama, alleging based on the WikiLeaks release of hacked Clinton campaign emails that the president knew about his secretary of state&#8217;s controversial use of a private email server at the time.After news broke about Clinton&#8217;s private server, her aide Cheryl Mills apparently wrote senior staffer John Podesta, now the candidate&#8217;s campaign chairman, on March 7, 2015, to say &#8220;we need to clean this up.&#8221;&#8220;He (Obama) has emails from her &#8212; they do not say state.gov,&#8221; Mills wrote, in the email quoted by Trump &#8212; which he said contradicted Obama&#8217;s claim to have learned about the private server from news reports.&#8220;In other words, they were saying he had to know Hillary was using an illegal server but he claimed otherwise,&#8221; Trump told his Tallahassee rally. &#8220;That means Obama is now into the act.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Threatens&#8217; democracy &#8211;Trump&#8217;s standing in polls has been hit hard, particularly among female voters, since this month&#8217;s release of a 2005 video on which he boasts that his celebrity allows him to grope women with impunity.Since then, about a dozen women have come forward with sexual misconduct allegations.But a more disciplined Trump largely stayed on message in Florida, attacking Clinton over taxes and foreign policy, and jabbing at her email scandal.&#8220;The criminal conduct of Hillary Clinton threatens the foundations of our democracy,&#8221; Trump said, after the Tallahassee crowd broke into chants of &#8220;Lock her up!&#8221;With his path to victory narrowing, Trump has railed against the &#8220;phony&#8221; polls and appealed to voters to turn out, calling it a &#8220;once-in-a-lifetime opportunity&#8221; to reject the political elite.Clinton, meanwhile, received an endorsement from the latest in a long line of prominent Republicans who refuse to vote for their party&#8217;s nominee, as the ex-secretary of state and retired four-star general Colin Powell announced he would vote for her.-AFP
