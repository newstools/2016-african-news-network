&nbsp;Online shopping is poised to set a record this holiday season, according to the findings of a new Deloitte report.In the 31st edition of their annual holiday survey of consumer spending intentions, Deloitte analysts found that 50 percent of survey respondents in the US plan to shop online for gifts this season, making the Internet the top shopping destination over discount and value department stores.For the first time, the survey also showed that shoppers plan to spend about 47 percent of their budget online, matching what they plan to spend at brick and mortar stores.And fewer respondents will be visiting big box retail stores and traditional malls this year, in favor of shopping from the comfort of their own home.Overall, holiday shoppers said they plan to purchase an average of 14 gifts this year, on par with 2015, and spend an average of $426 on gifts and gift cards.Non-gift expenditures like holiday travel, dining out, entertainment, clothing, furnishing and decorations average $572 in this year&#8217;s survey.-Relaxnews
