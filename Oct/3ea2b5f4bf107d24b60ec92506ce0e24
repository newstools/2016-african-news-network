The City of Johannesburg has invested R20m in redeveloping two streets in Meadowlands, Soweto.Forbes and Sanders streets in Meadowlands, Soweto are receiving major upgrades and safety features which will include cycle lanes, walkways, kerbing and improved storm water systems to handle the possibility of flash floods in the area.The R20m project will cover 1.9 km of roads and will allow all users access to roads in diverse modes.Member of the Mayoral Committee of Transport Nonhlanhla Makhuba hosted the Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg Herman Mashaba in showcasing both the Rea Vaya BRT and the upgrading of roads in Soweto. The Rea Vaya BRT has become part of the lifeblood of Soweto. Over 50 000 passengers use the Rea Vaya daily including commuters, learners and people going to the shops, or going to collect their pensions,&#8221; Makhuba said.The City has sought to improve the service offered by the 277 buses travelling on 41km of dedicated trunk route, since the initiation of Rea Vaya.During the launch of the project, Mayor Herman Mashaba said the redevelopment in Meadowlands forms part of the City of Johannesburg s complete streets project which aims to make public roads accessible to all road users. Despite the current drought conditions, long-time residents of Soweto are well aware of the dangers associated with sudden downpours that can result in flash floods, said Mashaba.MMC for Transport Nonhlanhla Makhuba confirmed the City has identified a number of flood hotspots including in Braamfischerville, Diepsloot, Dobsonville, Orange Farm, Orlando East, Ivory Park and North Riding. More than R6.2-million has been allocated in the current budget to improve storm water systems in high risk areas by facilitating the draining of water and reducing the risks associated with heavy rains, said Makhuba.The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) will ensure that the City s physical road infrastructure is able to withstand the impact of sudden heavy rains and the roads, gutters, bridges and storm water systems are able to cope with the flow of large volumes of water.-Simangele Legodi
