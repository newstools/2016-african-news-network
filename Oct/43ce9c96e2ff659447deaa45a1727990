A 17-year-old girl from the small town of Oranjeville in the Free State is one of six South African youths documented in a 13-episode series Future Leaders.Mantshadi Khoadi was documented as one of the youths for tackling alcohol abuse and other related social problems in communities.According to the South African Breweries corporate affairs manager in the central region Kgosi Mogotsi, six teenagers, whose journeys are featured on Future Leaders, are becoming positive role models and agents of positive change within their respective communities and among their peers.He said the Grade 11 pupil was passionate about helping the less fortunate. She enjoys agriculture and farming as well as singing in the choir, Mogotsi said.He said they believed in growing and harnessing leadership skills among youth leaders who are concerned and involved in uplifting their communities. The initiatives taken by these young leaders need to be amplified and supported so that they continue to invest in their quest for community development, Mogotsi said.With the assistance of the local municipality, Khoadi s dream to start a food forest (community garden) for her community was realised about two weeks ago.She said the local municipality allocated four hectares of land to set up her community garden. The Future Leader had the opportunity of handing over the garden to her community this past weekend as part of her project big reveal . My community garden will see needy families and teenagers grow their own vegetables to consume as well as selling for income generation. I am also hoping to set up a farmers market where locals can purchase fresh food and vegetables, my hope is to make this a sustainable project that can take place seasonally within my community, Khoadi said.Mogotsi said that the initiatives taken by these young leaders needed to be applauded and supported for them to continue investing for community development.Becker Semelabeckers@thenewage.co.za
