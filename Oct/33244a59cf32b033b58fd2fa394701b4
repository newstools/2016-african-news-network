Silicon Valley, the hub of the US tech industry, is traditionally a Democratic political stronghold.But that has perhaps never more been more true than in this election year, with a presidential contest featuring a Republican nominee seen here as more interested in returning to the past than building the future.It is no understatement to say Donald Trump is unpopular among California&#8217;s tech titans.Along with overwhelmingly donating their dollars to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, many are openly campaigning for Trump&#8217;s defeat.Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Twitter co-founder Ev Williams and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales were among more than 100 people who recently signed an open letter from the tech industry taking a stand against the real estate tycoon.&#8220;We have listened to Donald Trump over the past year and we have concluded: Trump would be a disaster for innovation,&#8221; the letter read.&#8220;His vision stands against the open exchange of ideas, free movement of people, and productive engagement with the outside world that is critical to our economy.&#8221;Trump has railed against immigrants, proposed &#8220;shutting down&#8221; part of the internet as a security move, criticized Apple for making its products abroad and accused online retail giant Amazon of &#8220;getting away with murder, tax-wise.&#8221;Geoffrey Skelley at the University of Virginia&#8217;s Center for Politics said the tech sector is also fearful that Trump could start a trade war that would hurt firms with global ambitions.Instead of focusing on the future and technology, Trump appears to his detractors to be bent on resurrecting manufacturing jobs from a bygone era.&#8220;Trump is pretty anathema to the things that Silicon Valley wants,&#8221; said Melinda Jackson, an associate professor of political science at San Jose State University.&#8220;He seems to be backward-looking &#8212; to make things like they were before,&#8221; Jackson told AFP. &#8220;And Silicon Valley is about new innovation and the next big thing.&#8221;&#8211; Deep Clinton roots &#8211;While Google has laid out a mission of making the world&#8217;s information freely available and Facebook is striving to connect everyone on the planet, Trump has branded the media an enemy and vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep people out.Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg shot down the idea of a Mexico wall at a developers conference in San Francisco earlier this year.Careful not to make a direct link to Trump&#8217;s rhetoric, Zuckerberg nonetheless urged those tailoring software for the social network to &#8220;choose hope over fear&#8221; and to help people build bridges instead of walls.Another Facebook co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz, and his wife committed $20 million to Democratic causes and backed Clinton in the first-ever political endorsement of a candidate by the power couple.&#8220;It is clear that if Secretary Clinton wins the election, America will advance much further toward the world we hope to see,&#8221; Moskovitz and his wife said in an online post.&#8220;Donald Trump wins, the country will fall backward, and become more isolated from the global community,&#8221; they said.Fundraising events for Clinton in Silicon Valley have included one hosted by Apple chief executive Tim Cook &#8212; reportedly once touted as a possible Clinton vice presidential pick &#8212; and another by the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.&#8220;The Clintons, and Hillary&#8217;s roots in particular, go deep here,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;She is a known quantity. They trust her for the most part and feel they would at least know what to expect.&#8221;&#8211; Mirror opposite &#8211;Apple skipped providing funding or support for the Republican national presidential convention this year citing Trump&#8217;s comments about immigrants, minorities and women.&#8220;Trump represents the mirror opposite of everything they believe (in Silicon Valley); welcoming immigrants, a cosmopolitan global world order,&#8221; said Gregory Ferenstein, author of &#8220;The Age of Optimists,&#8221; about how technology transforms lives and politics.LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has been an outspoken Trump opponent, promising to donate $5 million to veterans&#8217; charities if the Republican candidate releases his tax returns, which he has so far refused to do.Trump has also been engaged in a nasty feud with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, accusing him of using The Washington Post, which Bezos bought for $250 million three years ago, as a weapon against him.&#8220;He&#8217;s using that as a tool for political power against me and against other people, and I&#8217;ll tell you what, we can&#8217;t let him get away with it,&#8221; Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News.Trump went on to say that Bezos is &#8220;using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don&#8217;t tax Amazon like they should be taxed.&#8221;&#8211; Trump&#8217;s backers &#8211;Trump is not completely without support in Silicon Valley.High-profile PayPal founder-turned-venture-capitalist Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, delivered a keynote speech at the Republican convention and has donated significant sums to Trump&#8217;s campaign.That prompted former Reddit chief Ellen Pao to sever ties between Project Include, which is devoted to promoting diversity in the tech industry, and Y Combinator, a startup incubator Thiel is involved with.&#8220;We are completely outraged to read about Thiel donating $1.25 million to Trump,&#8221; Pao wrote in an online post. &#8220;While all of us believe in the ideas of free speech and open platforms, we draw a line here.&#8220;Giving more power to someone whose ascension and behavior strike fear into so many people is unacceptable,&#8221; she said.-AFP
