A memorial service for 23-year-old Benjamin Phehla, Tshwane University of Technology s (TUT) outgoing SRC president, who died after a car ploughed into students during a #FeesMustFall protest, will be held on Wednesday at the institution s Soshanguve campus.The South African Students Congress (Sasco) in Gauteng planned the memorial service in honour of their fallen member.Provincial secretary Buthanan Ngwane said Sasco was saddened by the loss of a dedicated cadre and that his death would not be in vain. This is a great loss to us. He was one of the leaders of the organisation. The struggle will continue, he said.Ngwane described Phehla as a humble person who never quarrelled with anyone. He said his death was more sad because Phehla would have been the first person in his family to graduate.The university s SRC said it would call a press conference later this week to discuss Phehla s death and the arrangements for his memorial.Phehla was with a group of students who disrupted traffic on the road between TUT s Soshanguve north and south campuses on Thursday night when he was hit by a car. He died in hospital the next day. The driver apparently lost control of his vehicle and ploughed into the group. Three other students were injured in the fray.It is believed the protest was sparked by the university s failure to grant them transport for the march to the Union Buildings.The police initially opened a case of reckless and negligent driving, which was later changed to culpable homicide after Phehla died.A case of malicious damage to property has also been opened after angry students stoned the driver s car and burnt the belongings at his home following the incident.Phehla was in the residence committee in 2014-15 and part of the information and communications technology (ICT) student faculty council year for 2015-16.Condolences have poured in for the TUT student, including from President Jacob Zuma and Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande.Nzimande called on motorists to be vigilant when driving in areas with institutions and to be on the lookout for protesting students.Meanwhile, a suspected robber died and two others were fighting for their lives in a Mthatha hospital yesterday after being beaten up by Walter Sisulu University students.WSU spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo said the three illegally entered the institution s residence on Friday to steal from female students. The trio of robbers was found, captured and beaten by students. When the ambulance finally gained access into the university to bring aid to the three would-be robbers, they were in poor shape, Tukwayo said.Lillian Selapisasnn4@thenewage.co.za
