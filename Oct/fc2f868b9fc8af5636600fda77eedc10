FORMER Wits SRC president and #FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini could spend the next three years behind bars if the five charges he is facing stick.Mcebo is expected to make his second court appearance today in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court on charges of public violence, possession of dangerous weapons, assault with grievous bodily harm, theft and malicious damage to property.According to police, anyone convicted of possession of a dangerous weapon can be fined or held in jail for less than three years while sentences for other minor charges depend on each case.Dlamini was arrested at the weekend at his Wits University residence.His case was postponed yesterday after a brief appearance and he was sent back to the Cleveland police cells. Prosecutor Steven Rubin said the case had to be postponed to verify Dlamini s residential address.He said the state could not accept the Wits address provided by Dlamini as the university would close in the next two months.Dlamini was one of 567 people arrested since February 1 in connection with the violent protests that have been disrupting South African universities.The 567 arrestees have been linked to 265 cases, according to acting national police commissioner Lt-Gen Khomotso Phahlane.Briefing the media yesterday, Phahlane urged those who were making statements on behalf of the police to stop doing so. He also said police had come under extreme provocation, but were under firm orders not to retaliate.Police were planning to engage the owners of filling stations about selling petrol, which was used to make petrol bombs, to students. The SAPS, Phlahlane said, had not taken over operational control of any institution of higher learning.Yesterday it was reported that police had gone into a level three security situation at the University of Cape Town. There is no such declaration in any institution across the country. It is far from the truth. As the SAPS we continue to deploy in and around institutions of higher learning to combat crime, to investigate crime.We do that in line with the mandate of the SAPS. That notion of a level three classification cannot be correct. We must discourage people from making statements, he said.&#8211;BATANDWA MALINGO AND DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
