She also committed to no longer use consultants to carry out her offices investigations.Revelations that donor funding was received by the Public Protector raised alarm bells for MPs on Wednesday who cautioned this practice.Read: Mkhwebane not in competition with MadonselaNational Freedom Party MP Sibusiso Mncwabe said he was shocked at the USAid donation. For such an office with critical information, to receive international donations doesn t augur well. As Parliament, we must do our best to fund this office fully. This is a threat to the sovereignty of our state, he said.EFF MP Sam Matiase agreed with Mncwabe, saying: It can t be right that the Public Protector was getting funds from USAid. On Thursday, Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane told journalists during a live press briefing that &#8220;what we will be doing is to approach Parliament to request additional funding so as to avoid having to rely on donors. A set of questions requesting clarity on the matter sent to the Office of the Public Protector had yet to be responded to at the time of publishing.-TNA Reporter
