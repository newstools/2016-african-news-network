The SACP has welcomed the resumption of academic activities at some universities in the country.SACP Gauteng provincial secretary Jacob Mamabolo said yesterday that the communists lauded efforts by the Progressive Youth Alliance, composed of the ANC Youth League, Young Communist League and the South African Students Congress, in resolving violent student protests across the country. We are encouraged that while there are marginal sections in our campuses that are hell bent on disrupting learning, the majority of the student population have gone back to class, Mamabolo said.He said that the resumption of academic programmes at institutions of higher learning would assist the government in crafting medium to long term solutions to the fees crisis. We believe that the return to class brings the much needed impetus and moral high ground to take forward the historic demand for a working class-based free quality education. Mamabolo s comments come against the background of divided opinion on the interpretation of the Freedom Charter and its promises on education. Addressing a biennial heads of mission conference on Tuesday, President Jacob Zuma said the ANC went beyond the vision of the Freedom Charter on education by providing financial assistance to students on the basis of both merit and need.Mamabolo, making reference to violent conduct by students during the wave of #FeesMustFall protests, reiterated calls that violent conduct took away from the totality of genuine student demands. We remain convinced that the recent wave of violence, anarchy and destruction undermines the historic validity of this demand and the right to learn. Mamabolo urged students to make up lost ground on teaching due to protest activity in an effort to complete the academic year.He also called on law enforcement agencies to bring to book those who were responsible for public violence and the destruction of public property among others during protest activities.TNA Reporternews@thenewage.co.za
