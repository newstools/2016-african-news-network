Another building has been gutted by fire during the national student protests for free de-colonised education on Monday morning at the Nelson Mandela Municipality University(NMMU).The Xanadu Melody clubhouse on the main campus was set alight during the early hours of Monday morning.The NMMU Fees Must Fall Movement has condemned and distanced itself from the gutted infrastructure on Monday and students on social media did not take the violent act lightly.&#8220;We have been informed of an NMMU facility that was set alight in the early hours of the morning.&#8220;We are very angry that our facilities have been disrespected to this degree, similarly we are of the opinion that arson is not a revolutionary act but a crime that should not go unattended, thus as a movement we strongly condemn such acts,&#8221; said the movement on its Facebook account.The movement said it will work with law enforcement to ensure that those who threaten to harm resources are brought to book.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the institution is scheduled to resume academic activities on Monday after weeks of closure. There is currently a strong police presence.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
