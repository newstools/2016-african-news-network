MORE than 35000 people made their way to one of Mzansi s most anticipated concerts, Cassper Nyovest s Fill Up Orlando Stadium on Saturday. While the 26 year old might have fallen a little short of selling out all 40000 seats, the show has placed him in the history books of musicians such as the late Brenda Fassie and Lucky Dube who were known for filling up stadiums and concert halls back in their heyday. The Fill Up Orlando Stadium comes a year after the Fill Up the Dome concert in Johannesburg which saw a record 20000 people in attendance, making the Mama I Made It rapper the first South African hip hop artist to ever sell out the TicketPro Dome. &#8211;NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
