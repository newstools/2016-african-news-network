The visiting side almost snatched a late equaliser but defender Diego Godin&#8217;s header went straight towards Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico.Sevilla top the standings with 20 points, while Atletico slip from first to third on 18. Real Madrid, on 18, will go top if they beat Athletic Bilbao later on Sunday.-Reuters
