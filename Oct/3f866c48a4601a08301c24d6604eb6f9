The number of offenders studying through Unisa has doubled since the introduction of the state-of-the-art DCS-Unisa hubs that enable offenders to study online and perform better.Unisa deputy registrar Prof Michael Temane said offenders studying through Unisa had more than doubled at the Durban Westville Correctional Centre since the hubs were introduced in 2014. Female offenders increased from 12 to 33 and male offenders increased from 28 to 60 following growing performance outputs of those utilising three Unisa hubs established at the centre, Temane said.Unisa, which hosted a special graduation ceremony to award diplomas and degrees to 15 offenders, recently introduced its technologically advanced hubs as part of implementing a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Correctional Services.Temane said universities and the government should not lose sight of the higher education needs of those behind bars. Education is a pillar of offender rehabilitation that assists in empowering them to resist temptations to return to a life of crime, acting KZN deputy regional commissioner of correctional services Lucky Mthethwa said There are 539 offenders studying through various higher education learning institutions in South Africa, 138 doing higher certificate programmes, 129 doing diplomas, 226 doing degree programmes and 46 doing their postgraduate studies this year.TNA Reporter
