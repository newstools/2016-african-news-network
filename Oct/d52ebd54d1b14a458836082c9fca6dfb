Fees Must Fall student leader Mcebo Dlamini has been denied bail in the Johannesburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Wednesday.Magistrate Albertus Roux said: &#8220;It would not be in the interest of justice to release the applicant on bail.&#8221;Dlamini&#8217;s case has been postponed to 15 November 2016 for trial at the Johannesburg High Court. He will appear in court on November 10 to conclude investigation.The Magistrate further labelled Dlamini as &#8216;dishonest&#8217; because he was told he was not honest with the court.Roux said: &#8220;the evidence in his affidavit is not convincing. The applicant was not always friendly and honest with the court.&#8221;Dlamini made his first brief court appearance on Monday and the state argued that he is a flight risk and might flee to Swaziland.His lawyer Mongezi opposed the state s request, citing he had tests to write at Witwatersrand University(Wits) on Tuesday. It was however revealed on Wednesday that Dlamini is not registered at Wits.Scores of Wits students came out to support the student activist during his appearance. Wits students have previously said that they fear student leaders are being targeted.Dlamini faces charges of possession of a dangerous weapon, theft, assault with grievous bodily harm, malicious damage to property and public violence.He was arrested at the Junction Residence Complex in the early hours of Sunday.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
