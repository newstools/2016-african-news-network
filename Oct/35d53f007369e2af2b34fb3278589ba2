&nbsp;The Hawks said they were doing their jobs when trying to obtain a document from a SARS employee last week.Yesterday a video showing members of the Hawks demanding a document from SARS employee Vlok Symington in the organisation s boardroom surfaced on social media with claims that Symington was held hostage.Hawks spokesperson Brig Hulani Mulaudzi denied the hostage claims, saying Symington decided to run to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). The video does not show anyone being held hostage.Our members were on duty and went there to obtain a document that was in the person s possession illegally.But he decided to run to Ipid when he knows the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation judge s office is the one that investigates complaints against the Hawks.Now our members under Xaba are being asked to report to the Ipid offices, he said. However, Mulaudzi said if they have to cooperate with Ipid, they will.The claimed hostage situation was related to an email sent out by SARS lawyer David Maphakela where he said for ethical reasons he did not want to be involved, neither did he support the NPA or the Hawks in their investigation of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two other former top SARS officials.This is amid an application in the North Gauteng High Court to stop the NPA from prosecuting Gordhan. The application was filed by the Helen Suzman Foundation early this week.The NPA announced it was charging Gordan with fraud two weeks ago. The fraud allegedly committed by Gordhan relates to the early retirement of his former deputy at SARS Ivan Pillay. In 2010 Pillay took early retirement for personal reasons.Gordhan approved the payment of R1 141178 from the SARS budget to the Government Employees Pension Fund.Dudu Dube| dudud@thenewage.co.za
