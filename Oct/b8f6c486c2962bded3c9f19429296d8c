The case will be concluded and is being adjudicated by an independent panel, he said.Last year Bopape was referred to the integrity commissioner, by Makhura, following allegations by officials of the Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation department who accused her of being implicated in irregular tender activities amounting to R10 million.Bopape was accused of influencing the awarding of security tender to a company of her choice.She also faces allegations of having spent more than R300,000 on security upgrades to her Pretoria home.
