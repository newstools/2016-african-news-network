Twelve Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) students have been granted bail of R3000 each on Wednesday.Among their bail conditions is that they cannot leave the Western Cape without detective&#8217;s permission, must not set foot anywhere close to the university and must report to Belhar Police Station three times a week, every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday.The court has postponed their case to 12 December for investigations to be completed.Magistrate Ronald Rickets said: &#8220;the court must make an example that no one must destroy property.&#8221;&#8220;Accused must not set foot anywhere close to a University and reside at the Methodist Church address.&#8221;The students defence said: &#8220;we welcome the state not opposing bail. But the amount (R3000) and conditions are unreasonable.&#8221; Furthermore saying some of the bail conditions are unconstitutional.Defence added that the institution is the only one that can suggest that accused students should not be 100m from the University not the state.He was adamant that students are fighting for free and fair quality education and that they are not criminals.Students are now joined by parents as they take to the streets of Bellville, walking to campus.The institution on Tuesday suspended all academic activities on all CPUT campuses with immediate effect. The bulk of examinations will take place at the Wingfield Military Base.Last week, two Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) buildings, at the Bellville campus, were set alight.The guardhouse entrance is one of the buildings that were set alight. Fire services doused flames at the Security Control Centre.This comes after protests in the early hours of the morning, which lead to private securities being removed by police.TNA Reporter
