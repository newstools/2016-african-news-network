As much as we are saying one life is too many, it is still the safest mode of public transport for the number and capacities we are able to hold, she added.Mofokeng said human error caused the train crash that resulted in one person losing a life. She however dismissed the idea that the accident might have been caused by the ageing signal systems.-Sipho Jack
