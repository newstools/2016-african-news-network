The International Criminal Court on Saturday asked South Africa and Burundi to reconsider their decisions to withdraw from the troubled institution that was set up to try the world&#8217;s worst crimes.&#8220;Although withdrawing from a treaty is a sovereign act, I regret these decisions and invite South Africa and Burundi to reconsider their positions,&#8221; said Sidiki Kaba, president of the assembly of state parties to the ICC founding treaty.&#8220;I urge them to work together with other States in the fight against impunity, which often causes massive violations of human rights,&#8221; Kaba said in a statement.The statement came a day after South Africa announced it would withdraw from the ICC.The announcement followed a dispute last year when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited the country despite facing an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes.The US government refused to endorse the Rome Statute.Earlier this month, Burundi said it would leave the court, while Namibia and Kenya have also raised the possibility.The African National Congress (ANC) in government said SA ICC withdrawal is long overdue.ANC in Parliament said it believe the International Criminal Court (ICC) has long diverted from its mandate of being an independent and objective instrument and welcomes Cabinet decision to withdraw from it.&#8220;The ICC has allowed non-member states to dictate and interfere with its work to suit their own imperialist agendas,&#8221; said ANC Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo in a statement.Justice Minister Michael Masutha on Friday cited conflict with South Africa&#8217;s conflict resolution commitment and the Rome Statute as reasons for the country&#8217;s imminent withdrawal from the International Criminal Court.Masutha confirmed that a written notice to withdraw from ICC has been submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General.The ICC, set up in 2002, is often accused of bias against Africa and has also struggled with a lack of cooperation, including from the United States which has signed the court&#8217;s treaty but never ratified it.Kaba said he was concerned that South Africa and Burundi&#8217;s decisions would &#8220;pave the way&#8221; to other African states leaving the court that is tasked with &#8220;prosecuting the most serious crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, namely genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression&#8221;.The ICC on Saturday also confirmed South Africa had officially notified the court of its decision to leave the court, adding that the move had come in the wake of Burundi&#8217;s withdrawal process.According to the ANC, government would remain committed to promoting human rights.&#8220;The ANC reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights on the continent of Africa and beyond.&#8220;We are steadfast in our belief that those who have committed crimes against humanity must be prosecuted and punished by an impartial body empowered by international cooperation to defend the universal values of justice,&#8221; Moloto said.Moloto said the ANC will be ready to carry out its legislative function as part of the Parliamentary process of repealing the Implementation of the Rome Statute once it has been introduced to Parliament by Cabinet.-TNA Reporter with AFP
