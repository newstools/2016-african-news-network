NEW public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane will address the media before the end of the week on issues she inherited, including the state capture report, from predecessor Thuli Madonsela. Yesterday was Mkhwebane’s first day in office and also the day the controversial state capture report, which contains findings into an alleged relationship between President Jacob Zuma and the Gupta family, was to be handed to her. This as a court case questioning the release of the report is due to be heard in the high court next month. Opposition parties said yesterday that returning a report that is already finished and signed off by the office of the public protector simply doesn’t make any sense. They also called on Parliament to make public a letter written to it by Madonsela where she urged that the report be kept safe. The release of the report was postponed last Friday when President Jacob Zuma interdicted Madonsela on her last day in office. The president wrote to Madonsela saying that she didn’t give him enough time to prepare and to give evidence on a whole range of matters which exceeded the ambit of the stated request for the meeting. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen also blocked the release of the report. As part of his affidavit to interdict the release of the report, Van Rooyen said he could not answer the questions Madonsela had presented him and needed more time. –DUDU DUBE
