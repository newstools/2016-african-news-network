Cpt, Dbn then Jhb?&#8221; asked Cassper.The Twitter poll is sitting at over 2000 votes so far.Hopeful fans have even taken it a step further challenging the rapper to take it abroad to Wembley stadium in London.Cassper s FillUpOrlandoStadium concert took place this past weekend and featured performances local musicians including Babes Wodumo, Riky Rick and Nasty C among others.Fill Up Orlando Stadium comes a year after the Fill Up the Dome concert in Johannesburg which saw a record of 20000 people in attendance, making the Mama I Made It rapper the first South African hip hop artist to ever sell out the TicketPro Dome.While the 26-year-old might have fallen a little short of selling out all 40000 seats at Orlando Stadium, the show has placed him in the history books of musicians such as the late Brenda Fassie and Lucky Dube who were known for filling up stadiums and concert halls back in their heyday.Cassper also announced that he plans to Fill Up FNB stadium, which has a capacity of 94,736, in 2017.&#8220;Closing moment for #FillUpOrlandoStadium !!!
