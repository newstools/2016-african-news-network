Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that he had no preference in the US election race between Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, saying it was a choice between &#8220;bad and worse&#8221;.&#8220;At the UN, the leader of a country asked me which of the candidates I preferred. I responded: &#8216;Do I prefer the bad over the worse, or the worse over the bad?&#8221; Rouhani said at a speech in Arak in central Iran.The moderate president said he was struck by the way in which the American candidates &#8220;accuse and insult each other&#8221;. &#8220;Do we want this kind of democracy in our country? This kind of election?&#8221; he asked.He said &#8220;morality does not exist&#8221; in the United States &#8220;which pretends to have had democracy for 200 years&#8221;.Rouhani has sought to improve relations with the West, signing a nuclear accord last year with world powers that led to the lifting of sanctions and raised hopes that Iran would return to the international fold. Trump has vowed to &#8220;tear up&#8221; the nuclear agreement and Iran&#8217;s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded that he would happily &#8220;burn&#8221; the agreement if that was the case. Rouhani himself faces re-election in May 2013 and is set for a tough battle against conservatives who dislike his overtures to the West and say the nuclear deal has failed to bring significant economic benefits to Iran.-AFP
