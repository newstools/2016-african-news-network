The Gauteng Liquor Board is on a massive campaign to encourage compliance and modernisation of the province s liquor trading sector.The board last week held a men in liquor business workshop that was aimed at enhancing compliance with the Gauteng Liquor Act by liquor traders and promoting responsible trading.Cleo Bodeibe-Lushaba, director of client relation management at the board, said the sector is of great importance to the economy of the province because it provided sustainable employment, but it requires control and proper management. There are 15000 licensed liquor traders in the province and each one employs a minimum of five people. This sector has had a massive economic impact in the province, she said.Bodeibe-Lushaba said the move was in line with the government s commitment to transformation, modernisation and re-industrialisation of township economies.She cautioned the public on alcohol abuse, saying it was costly for the government to deal with the negative aspects of alcohol. We spent over R60m during the 2014-15 financial year. With the year end and the festive season approaching, binge drinking by the youth and general excessive alcohol consumption by consumers becomes prevalent, she said.Parliament has proposed amendments to the National Liquor Act, which is now open for public comment, including to raise the age of drinking to 21 in South Africa and introducing civil liability for proprietors, suppliers and manufacturers who serve to people who cause accidents or commit crimes while intoxicated.Analyst and CEO of consulting firm Global Brains Dr Blessing Kasiyamhuru praised the move by the liquor board to empower liquor traders with knowledge of the industry.He said innovation, entrepreneurship and small business development were areas the government needed to focus on with every ounce of collective energy.He said the number of people employed in the sector showed small enterprises support the province in matters of employment. Sustainable small business development can only be achieved if the three spheres of government, the private sector and civil society work together, enhanced support to SMMEs and co-operatives, which are critical in job creation and economic growth, he said.He said growing the small business sector would give the government the ammunition to defeat the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality.Samuel Mungadzeprovinces@thenewage.co.za
