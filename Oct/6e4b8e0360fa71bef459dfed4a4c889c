The government was watching SAA with the eyes of a hawk and has no plans to sell the airline, President Jacob Zuma told the National Council of Provinces yesterday.Appointing a new board filled with different skills, he added, would ensure that SAA was turned around successfully. That was one of the matters that rating agencies would have looked at, the president said.Answering questions in the NCOP, he said Cabinet had approved the reappointment of Dudu Miyeni as chairperson. The chairperson works with a collective to achieve goals set by shareholders, which is government represented by the minister of finance. The government is optimistic it will achieve the necessary turnaround that the country needs. The appointment of Miyeni and the board, he said: is for the interest of the company. Nothing more . Zuma said he was not looking at disposing of the SAA. I m not looking at selling this company. I m looking at this company getting back to being viable and working. SAA, he said, has been in trouble for a some time.However, a lot of work has gone into the carrier with the full participation of the national Treasury to ensure SAA turns around. I can assure you there has been an improvement financially. We are looking at it very closely. We are more hands-on as government. That is why we put it under Treasury so it can be looked at with the eyes of a hawk.Dennis Cruywagendennisc@thenewage.co.za
