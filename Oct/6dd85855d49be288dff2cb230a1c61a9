The Constitutional Court will today deliver judgment in the case of a Gauteng couple who lost their house due to the infamous Brusson scam.Christina Moore and her husband are one of many South Africans embroiled in court battles with Absa Bank over houses financed by the bank that were sold without their knowledge.The victims of the scam were duped into signing documentation under the impression that they were taking loans from Brusson Finance and putting up their properties as security when instead, they were signing their houses away to a new owner.In 2009 the Moores were desperate for money. They responded to an advert by a company that issued loans.It turned out later that they had unknowingly signed an offer to purchase in which the name of the purchaser Sunnyboy Kabini was later inserted. It later emerged that the company was running a widescale scam.It has now been liquidated but Absa bank says it cannot reverse the purchases. In their affidavit presented to the ConCourt, the Moores argue that Absa cannot hold them responsible because they were victims of a scam. The Moores were in desperate need of money. They applied to Brusson for a loan. It told them it was willing to grant them a loan against the security of their family home. They signed a series of documents which, they thought, gave effect to such a loan. They had until then had five mortgage loans with Absa. The proceeds of the loan they received from Brusson were in part used to settle their debts to Absa to relieve their property of the Absa mortgage bonds, their lawyers say in court papers.Absa, which is the applicant in the matter before the ConCourt and is also a victim of the Brusson scam, argues that the Moores willingly signed the documents without thoroughly understanding them.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
