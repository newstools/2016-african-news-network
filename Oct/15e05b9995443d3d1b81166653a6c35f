Only solution that we have is to reduce water consumption so that our reservoirs are able to recover. Bearing in mind that there is a heatwave, we advise residents to keep cool but not to be tempted to use water wastefully.Some of the things that they can do is to wear light clothes, to stay indoors, under the shade, not spray a water bottle on your face or put a wet face cloth and avoid all those other activities that consume a lot of water, Johannesburg Water Spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene.Meanwhile, the City of Tshwane stated that the current shortage of water is attributed to Rand Water unilaterally electing to cut 15% of the city&#8217;s water supply without prior notification or any plan to mitigate the shortages in the interim.&#8220;As such we are distributing water tankers and have requested for four more to be provided so that our residents don&#8217;t have to feel the entire burden of national governments inability to properly plan,&#8221; the city said in a statement.Water restrictions were implemented in September due to a drop in water levels at the dams and reservoirs as a result of the on-going drought.Water tankers are being distributed &amp; the City has requested for four more to be provided to the residents affected by the water shortage.&mdash; City of Tshwane (@CityTshwane) October 31, 2016We will ensure that the people of Tshwane have access to this precious resource.
