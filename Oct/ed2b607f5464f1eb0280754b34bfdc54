Mexico detained more than 20,000 unaccompanied child migrants, mostly from Central America, in 2015, authorities said on Monday.That was double the number of the year before and a sign of the worsening migration crisis in the region, where many pass through heading to seek refuge in the United States.Mexico&#8217;s National Human Rights Commission said the minors were at risk of kidnapping and rape by criminal gangs or even by corrupt officials.&#8220;The authorities are acting without considering the interests of the children and protecting them,&#8221; Luis Raul Gonzalez, president of the commission told a news conference, presenting the figures.He said most of the minors were from the crime- and poverty-plagued Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.&#8220;They are held in migrant centers instead of being immediately sent to reception centers where they can receive the assistance and protection they need in accordance with international standards,&#8221; he said.-AFP
