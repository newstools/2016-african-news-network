A 29 year old man found in possession of illegal rhino horns is expected to appear in the Ubombo Magistrate s Court this week.The suspect was arrested on Thursday afternoon at Mashibisa Store following a tip off about man carrying a suspicious bag.Police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane said upon arrival the police confronted the suspect who was carrying a yellow and black bag. They did preliminary investigations and discovered that he was carrying a rhino horn, Zwane said.The suspect was arrested and a case of possession of a rhino horn was opened at Mkuze police station for further investigations.In 2015 a total of 1175 rhinos were poached in South Africa, a slight decrease on the previous year when a record 1 215 rhinos were illegally poached.This is the first time the country has recorded a dip in poaching levels since 2007, when the rate of poaching began to escalate rapidly.So far this year more than 700 rhinos have been illegally killed with KwaZuluNatal accounting for at least 50 of those deaths.Acting provincial commissioner MajGen Bhekinkosi Langa said the arrest of the suspect will send a clear message to other poachers who are still at large. More arrests are expected to be made to those engaging themselves in criminal activities, especially the rhino poachers, Langa said. We will make sure that all the poachers are put behind bars and therefore ask the community to work with the police by providing valuable information that will led to the arrest and recovery of rhino horns, Langa said.The suspect who cannot be named at this time, will make his second court appearance soon and is expected to apply for bail.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
