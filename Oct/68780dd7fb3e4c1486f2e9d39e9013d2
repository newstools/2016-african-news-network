A child who was tucking into noodles at a popular Japanese restaurant found some extra topping in the bowl &#8212; the tip of a sliced finger, a health official said Thursday.A female customer complained to staff when her child made the gruesome finding at a &#8220;ramen&#8221; noodle outlet run by Kourakuen Holdings in the central Japanese city of Shizuoka last month.It turned out to be a piece of &#8220;nail with thick skin&#8221;, according to Masashi Goto, a local official in charge of inspecting food hygiene.&#8220;We were able to understand it was part of a finger,&#8221; he told AFP on the phone, adding that the tip was about one centimetre (0.4 inch) wide and 7-8 millimetres long.The shop&#8217;s operator has submitted a letter of apology to the health office and vowed to ensure that a similar incident does not happen again, he said.An official at Kourakuen Holdings, which operates a chain of &#8220;ramen&#8221; noodle restaurants in the country, said the incident occurred when a female kitchen worker accidentally cut her thumb while slicing a chunk of pork.The company said it had apologised to the customer but added that what had slipped into the bowl was not a fingertip but only a &#8220;nail&#8221;.Kourakuen operates more than 520 outlets in Japan.-AFP
