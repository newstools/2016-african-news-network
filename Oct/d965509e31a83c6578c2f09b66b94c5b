A stampede at a religious gathering in northern India killed at least 19 people Saturday as thousands of devotees of a controversial guru tried to cross a bridge at once, police said.The followers of Jai Gurudev, a leader of a local religious sect, had gathered on the outskirts of Varanasi, a Hindu holy town on the banks of the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh state, when the deadly stampede broke out.&#8220;A total of 19 people have died in the incident. Fourteen of the dead are women,&#8221; Hari Ram Sharma, police inspector general, told reporters in the state capital Lucknow.At least four others were seriously injured and were undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital.State police chief Javeed Ahmed blamed overcrowding on the old iron bridge for the disaster.&#8220;They had sought permission for 5,000 persons but many more people reached and joined the procession,&#8221; Ahmed told India&#8217;s NDTV news network.&#8220;They were crossing a bridge when some rumour-mongering happened which led to the disaster.&#8221;A spokesman of the religious sect said the stampede occurred after a rumour spread that the narrow bridge had collapsed, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported.&#8220;The devotees were proceeding towards the camp (across the river) but police started sending them back. This led to rumours that the bridge has collapsed,&#8221; Raj Bahadur told PTI.TV footage showed piles of colourful clothing and slippers lying in a heap with policemen trying to clear the debris.&#8220;There was a lot of chaos, all of us were pushed and shoved. Many people have died including my mother,&#8221; a witness told reporters as ambulances sped by.State Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has ordered a high-level enquiry into the tragedy while announcing monetary compensation for the victims, his spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said.Stampedes at India&#8217;s religious festivals, where a mixture of police and volunteer stewards are often overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowds, are not uncommon.In July last year, a stampede on the banks of a holy river killed 27 pilgrims in southern India.Around 115 people were killed in October 2013 at a stampede near a temple in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, site of another deadly stampede there seven years earlier.Jai Gurudev, who died in 2012, is among several charismatic self-styled &#8220;godmen&#8221; who enjoy a cult-like following among thousands of followers.Typically clad in white robes and turban, Gurudev fiercely espoused vegetarianism and claimed &#8220;to liberate the soul from the rotation of birth and death&#8221; on his website. In June, a breakaway sect of his followers were involved in a riot in Mathura city which killed 24 people.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by the loss of life in the latest incident.&#8220;I have spoken to officials &amp; asked them to ensure all possible help to those affected due to the stampede in Varanasi,&#8221; Modi tweeted.-AFP
