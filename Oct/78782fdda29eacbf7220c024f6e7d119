Time-wasting in football is a tactic many teams use when they want to salvage a point or need to protect a lead. But Chippa United coach Dan Malesela is not the least bit impressed by this irritating strategy.A fuming Malesela lambasted Bloemfontein Celtic for their time-wasting tactics during their Absa Premiership clash, singling our goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb for special criticism. The Chilli Boys were held to a goalless draw by Celtic in a highly competitive match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday. Malesela s side were desperately looking for a win at home to close the gap between them and joint log leaders Kaizer Chiefs and Golden Arrows. But it wasn t to be for the enterprising Port Elizabeth-based outfit. I m disappointed that we still see the same shenanigans that we saw last week, of goalkeepers falling down every minute, Malesela said. Is it tactics? People must watch people sitting on the floor or playing football? What tactics are those? It s wrong. It must be corrected and coaches must stop doing this because people want to watch football. They paid to watch football. I hope this does not continue because it s also so boring. It s dull and it s not okay for football. Tignyemb has admitted to wasting playing time, saying it was a tactic to use when they needed to salvage a point away from home. The Cameroonian goalie kept feigning injury as the clock ticked towards full time, much to the chagrin of the United bench. Sometimes you need to kill time, Tignyemb said. It is important away from home. You have to manage everything and make sure that at least you get something. ntsakom@thenewage.co.za-Ntsako Mashaba&nbsp;
