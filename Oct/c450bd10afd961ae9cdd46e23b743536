A doctor accused of raping a patient is due to appear at the Wynberg Magistrates Court on Tuesday for a formal bail application.Oluwabusuyi Babalola, 46, who worked as a locum at a Nyanga clinic was arrested in September for allegedly raping a 26-year-old woman.During his first court appearance, the state indicated that he could face more rape charges as the prosecution is waiting on other rape investigations dating back to 2014.In a similar incident, a doctor from Limpopo was accused of raping a patient in May this year.According to reports, the medical doctor from Lebowakgomo, Limpopo was placed on precautionary leave after allegations surfaced that he allegedly raped a patient at Lebowakgomo Hospital.The incident occurred after the patient, who had not finished her medical processes, was told to return the following day but because it was already late, the hospital offered her accommodation. The doctor allegedly took her to a quiet place inside the hospital and raped her, said Lebowakgomo police spokesperson WO Mananong Tshehla.The doctor was arrested seven days later, because police were not informed immediately after the alleged offence was committed.-TNA Reporter
