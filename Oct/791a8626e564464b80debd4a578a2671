Shipments of Apple computers slipped to 4.42 million in a decline of slightly more than eight percent from the same period a year earlier, according to industry tracker IDC.Industry reports released this month showed that shipments of personal computers overall slid anew in the recently ended quarter as lifestyles continued to shift to smartphones and tablets.&#8211; Dialing in TV &#8211;Apple on Thursday also introduced a new TV application crafted to use iPhones, iPads and internet-video streaming boxes hubs for television viewing.&#8220;Now, there is a unified TV experience; one place to discover and enjoy your favorite TV show and movies across all your devices,&#8221; Apple chief executive Tim Cook said at the event.Siri virtual assistant is built into the TV application, allowing people to ask for shows or searches naturally, a demonstration showed. The software allows for viewing live broadcasts and can search out content available in other applications on Apple TV. Notably absent from Apple&#8217;s television mix was leading on-deman video streaming service Netflix.&#8220;The new TV app should make Apple TV easier to use, and create something more analogous to the programming guides on pay TV services,&#8221; said analyst Dawson.&#8220;However, Apple&#8217;s ability to get holdout app makers like Netflix on board will determine how useful the app ultimately is the proposition breaks down pretty quickly if major apps are missing.&#8221; AFP
