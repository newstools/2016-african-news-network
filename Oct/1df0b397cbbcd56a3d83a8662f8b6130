Riding on a wave of nostalgia, US TV seems to be reviving one by one its former hit shows still loved by fans.Comedy series &#8220;Will &amp; Grace,&#8221; starring Debra Messing and Eric McCormack, could be next on the list.Could the two friends and New York roommates be set to return to NBC? Discussions are reportedly underway, according to Variety and Tvline, after the cast was reunited last month for a very special episode.Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes all star as their original &#8220;Will &amp; Grace&#8221; characters in a short (around 10 minutes) video supporting Hillary Clinton&#8217;s presidential election campaign.Their reunion clip has been viewed more than six million times online and could, it seems, have given everyone ideas.&#8220;Will &amp; Grace&#8221; ran from 1998 to 2006 on NBC, following the lives of Will, a gay lawyer, and his friend and roommate Grace, an interior designer, both of whom are looking for love. The series became a cult show and scooped 16 Emmy Awards over its eight seasons. NBC clearly has plenty of reasons to revive it.Over the last few years, US TV networks have jumped onboard the revival trend in a major way. Netflix has already brought &#8220;Arrested Development&#8221; and &#8220;Full House&#8221; back to screens and has a &#8220;Gilmore Girls&#8221; revival in store for November 25. Fox has brought back &#8220;The X-Files&#8221; and CBS has just relaunched &#8220;MacGyver.&#8221;The trend looks set to continue into 2017, with new episodes of &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; coming to Showtime. Fox has announced a &#8220;Prison Break&#8221; revival, while &#8220;Knight Rider&#8221; and &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; are both being rebooted on online streaming sites.Certain other cult series are also the subject of comeback rumors, but with no further details.Will Smith is reportedly trying to relaunch his 1990s sitcom &#8220;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,&#8221; modernizing it with new characters. ABC is apparently keen to bring back agent Sydney Bristow, formerly played by Jennifer Garner in the series &#8220;Alias.&#8221;-Relaxnews
