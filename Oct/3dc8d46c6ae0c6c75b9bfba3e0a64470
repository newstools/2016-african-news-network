Amid complaints of racism at a number of schools where black pupils have accused school management of racially-biased policies, Durban High School is hosting a series of cultural intelligence workshops across the country, with 20 staff members having already engaged in training in this subject over the last two years.Roy Hellenberg, the deputy principal of Durban High School, and Dylan Wray, the executive director of the teacher development NGO Shikaya, have spearheaded this initiative. Principals, management teams, teachers, pupils and even governing bodies are being called to begin an honest reflection on the environments created for young people to learn in, Hellenberg said. Some of the questions being asked are, What are the implicit and unconscious biases we as staff hold that are shaping our school cultures and impacting on the learning environments we seek to create? Are the structures, codes of conduct and behaviours in our schools truly nurturing inclusive environments where each young person feels seen and valued for who they are? Wray said.The workshop, or ReflectAction, is an interactive day of reflection for school principals, management teams and even governing bodies, to explore solutions that they can meaningfully act upon.The ReflectAction will help school leaders explore issues of identity and implicit bias in schools and understand what cultural intelligence is and how it prepares pupils for the 21st century. It starts with the top and filters down through the staff and teachers, to the pupils. If the current leaders can be more aware of their biases and begin to act in an unbiased nature, then it is sure to impact on the future leaders, Hellenberg said.For more information contact Caroline Harrison on 0312771500 or email caroline.harrison@durbanhighschool.co.za.There was an uproar at Queensburgh Girls High in Durban recently when black pupils accused the school of treating them differently to girls of other races, that they were not permitted to play indigenous games and were told to cut their hair which they were told looked messy . 701198
