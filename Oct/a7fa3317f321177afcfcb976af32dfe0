This year s medium-term budget policy statement comes at a time when South Africa is once again overshadowed by growing uncertainty and concerns over the future of the country facing challenges of chronic high unemployment and poverty.Concerns remain over diminishing prospects to realise the five key pillars of the country s development path due to the looming threat of downgrading the country s credit status by international rating agencies as well as lack of leadership in government and state-owned enterprises that are key to global competitiveness..How well will the policy statement respond to the education crisis in the face of universities facing weeks of shutdown due to student protests threatened by loss of the 2016 academic year?Will the finance minister commit additional funding to higher education or will he confirm, what we have known all along from various sources, that South Africa s spending priorities lie elsewhere?In the past 20 years South Africans have measured government spending largely against five pillars set out in the promise of the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), which are meeting basic needs, developing human resources, building the economy, democratising the state and implementing the RDP.Unfortunately, despite progressive government spending, developing human resources at a higher education level has been lagging behind.This promise, presented in various government policies adopted since 1994, has fresh relevance this year following the outcome of the August local government elections which provided an opportunity for elected representatives to renew their mandate.The local sphere of government has an important function in the realisation of the country s development path through implementation of various government policies adopted since 1994, especially at this time when the governing party has returned with a reduced majority and when key municipalities are governed by coalitions.Another unique factor that informs high expectations is the unusually high number of by-elections scheduled for November which may still shift further the balance of power in favour of opposition political parties and independent candidates in several municipal councils. The combination of these and other factors under the prevailing political climate tend to promote expediency in the form of pet projects to win political support at the expense of prudent expenditure frameworks that best meets the realisation of the promise.Under these circumstances, the finance minister s speech must mediate between short term and long-term policy priorities, taking into account the recent election promises made in election manifestos of various political parties as well as the results of Statistics South Africa s 2016 Community Survey released on June 30.A decisive political mediation remains the number one challenge given the fact that, in the first place, while different government departments in the three spheres of government tend to operate in silos in the execution of their mandate, citizens expect to enjoy basic services holistically, irrespective of the government line function responsible for delivery.It is often the lack of the government s response to shortcomings in the coordination of delivery of services by different government departments that often leads to the drop in confidence levels of citizens towards governments and often violent public protests.It is also these unresolved shortcomings that prevent successful graduated expenditure to other priority areas such as human resource development.Also, the mediation is important at this time because both the election manifestos of various political parties and the 2016 Community Survey reflect a shift in what political parties and communities see as priorities for the country in comparison with how priorities have been ranked in previous years.For example, the results of the 2016 Community Survey reflect in the top three out of 20 priorities, first, access to water; second, employment creation; and third, reducing the cost of electricity. Education or building human resources features as priority number 15.What makes this even more significant is that election manifestos launched early in the year and the corresponding election campaigns conducted in the run up to the August elections resonated with the ordering of these priorities even though the campaign environment has been affected by the student struggles for free tertiary education and decolonisation institutions of higher learning.Because of the changing order of priorities, South Africa needs more than ever decisive leadership in the form of a collective of members of the executive in the Cabinet to ensure that limited resources are spent optimally in a balanced manner for the overall benefit of the country and its citizens.This leadership must be demonstrated in this year s budget statement and must endure irrespective of how the predicted Cabinet reshuffle unfolds.Given the present uncertainty, this year s budget will do well to mediate the policy and fiscal space to ensure that advocacy for access to higher education becomes a matter for society as a whole and is not confined to higher education students alone, just as it was a matter for the high school students in the 1976 Soweto uprising.A firm commitment of resources to ensure access to good quality higher education will be a step in the right direction as an extension of the country s commitment to primary education which has resulted in the improvement of quality of life for citizens.The urgency to act boldly on the commitment to develop human resources is also underpinned by South Africa s window of opportunity to invest in years of schooling for the youth to benefit from the demographic dividend of having a large youthful population.Failing to act boldly at this stage will make South Africa s development challenge a lot more precarious as it will again miss out on the second wave of youth because, according to Statistics South Africa, fewer citizens are having fewer children compared to the generation before them. It is not too late to take action.Nkosikhulule Xhawulengweni NyembeziNkosikhulule Xhawulengweni Nyembezi is a researcher, policy analyst, human rights activist and board
