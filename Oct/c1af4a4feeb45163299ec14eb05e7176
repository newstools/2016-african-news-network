The Constitutional Court has sent the dispute over water tariffs between Merafong municipality and mining giant Anglo Ashanti back to the high court, saying the court should determine the legality of the minister s 2005 decision favouring the company.Merafong and Anglo Ashanti have been in a battle for the past 11 years since the then minister of water affairs overturned a decision by the municipality to levy a surcharge on water supply to the mining company.Anglo Ashanti, which has more than three mines in Merafong, had been getting water supply from Rand Water until 2004 when the municipality began implementing the Water Services Act. Merafong announced the new tariffs in May 2004.They were a lot higher than Rand Water s tariffs. But Merafong couldn t provide water services, so it appointed Rand Water as its agent to collect payment. After deducting its share, Rand Water would pay the balance the surcharge Merafong had added into the coffers of Merafong, the judgment by the Concourt s justice Edwin Cameron reads.However, Anglo Ashanti objected to the changes, leading to the minister to intervene. After hearing both sides, the minister found that the tariff increase unreasonable because Merafong would add no value to the services Rand Water provided to Anglo Gold.She ordered the two parties to negotiate. In the Concourt, Merafong was challenging the minister s intervention and subsequent ruling.Cameron remitted the matter to the high court, saying Merafong must be permitted to raise a challenge to the minister s decision.DUDU DUBE|dudud@thenewage.co.za
