In the National Assembly in Cape Town yesterday, Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan was trying to calm the markets, taxpayers, citizens and others with a delicately-crafted mini budget address.Outside Parliament, police were trying to calm riotous students intent on storming its gates to make their point about free higher education.Several shops were damaged by protesting students who blockaded roads with burning rubbish bins. Chaos broke out in the city when about 5000 students marched to Parliament.One of the protesting students was injured after being hit by a brick in the head. Teargas, stun grenades and water cannons were used to disperse students who refused to leave Parliament Street.The unrest started after students set alight a box and threw it at the police outside Parliament. The box was carried from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology campus to Parliament. It had the names of premier Helen Zille, Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande and the vice-chancellor of CPUT, Dr Max Prins, written in bold letters on it.Students stoned police with bricks and smashed shop windows. Student leader Lontu Sokutu said: If the government thinks that we are going to back down, they have a thing coming. We will not allow any university to open its doors until fees have fallen and the outsourcing of staff has stopped. Meanwhile, there was not a lot of good news from Gordhan. The economy is in distress. As a nation we are at a crossroad, politically and economically. However, he said, if we do the right things to support investment and confidence, our recovery will be more rapid . We must ask what is working for us and what is not, and what needs to change, Gordhan said.The biggest winner was tertiary education with a further R9bn for the financial aid scheme, in addition to the R16bn announced in the February budget.An extra R17.3bn will be set aside for the next three years. 701198
