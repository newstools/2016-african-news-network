The opening of an inquest into liberation struggle icon Ahmed Timol s death was about correcting history more than about bringing his killers to justice.This week, 45 years after police claimed Timol committed suicide by jumping from the Johannesburg central police station building, the National Prosecuting Authority said there was compelling evidence that necessitated the reopening of the inquest in the interest of justice.He was a 30-year-old schoolteacher and political activist.His nephew, Imtiaz Cajee, who together with the family have never believed the suicide claims, said what they wanted was for a 1972 court finding that his uncle committed suicide to be set aside. We are aware that most apartheid security police who were responsible for my uncle s death have passed away. We want the findings to be reversed. We want it to be declared that the findings by the magistrates were incorrect, he said.In the next three days commemorations marking the 45th anniversary of Timol s death will be held in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape.An exhibition in his honour will be held in King Williams Town and followed by a memorial lecture at the Princess La Dluli Community Hall in Pongola on Sunday.Cajee said the NPA s decision to open the inquest was a step forward to finding closure for the family.In 1996, Timol s mother pleaded with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to uncover the truth about her son s death. Members of the family, close friends and his comrades never believed that he committed suicide. It wasn t in his character to give up. They believe he was either tortured to death and thrown from the window or pushed. Despite the presentation of medical evidence of gruesome torture, the magistrate who conducted the inquest at the height of apartheid bought the security police version that they had treated Timol compassionately and found that nobody could be held responsible for his death, Cajee said in a statement.The NPA s decision has been welcomed by various organisations.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
