With victory in their eyes and the lifting of the Currie Cup in Bloemfontein beckoning, Bulls coach Noillis Marais said the opportunities on the day should be converted to points.The Cheetahs are a force that has dominated the Currie Cup but the Bulls coach said his team has to be accurate and make sure the Free state side don t have turn overs to play from. I think the guys that are going to use their opportunities the best are the guys that are going to win this weekend, the coach said.The coach has made mention of Mamelodi Sundowns, wishing them luck and saying he is confident they will win it, showing solidarity and support for a fellow Tshwane sporting team.The coach said that he didn t expect to reach the final but he had always wanted it, the next 80 minutes will show how successful the season is&#8230;the cup will show how good you are, and hopefully we can win in Bloemfontein. A lot of effort and time goes into the players. I&#8217;ve got a great coaching staff assisting me all the time and they have to get a lot of credit because they do a lot of work behind the scenes, Marais said.The Cheetahs vs Blue Bulls final will take place at the Toyota Stadium (Free State Stadium) in Bloemfontein. Kick off is scheduled for 4pm, this epic battle wont be a new one.The teams have met for nine matches in a podium match and the Bulls have the edge, winning seven of the nine times they have faced-off.In the Cheetahs camp Charles Marais replaces Ox Nche, with Nche moving to the bench. The Cheetahs have a very good chance to cap off a great season by making home advantage count and getting hold of the trophy at their home ground.The teams last met in the final of 2009 where the Bulls triumphed 36 to the Cheetahs 24. The hope for the Cheetahs is to make sure this does not happen again. The men from Bloem will have the favourites tag on them as they have been unbeaten thus far.The Cheetahs team 1)Charles Marais 2)Torsten van Jaarsveld 3)Johan Coetzee 4)Justin Basson 5)Reniel Hugo ( VC ) 6)Paul Schoeman 7)Uzair Cassiem 8)Niell Jordaan 9)Shaun Venter 10)Niel Marais 11)Rymond Rhule 12)Nico Lee 13)Francios Venter ( C ) 14)Sergeal Petersen 15)Clayton Blommetjies-Lehlohonolo Mashigo
