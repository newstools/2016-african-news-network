Egypt on Saturday condemned the Saudi head of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation for mocking its President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in comments that provoked outrage among Egyptians.OIC Secretary General Iyad Madani, a former Saudi minister, had mixed up Sisi&#8217;s name with that of Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi.&#8220;Mr President Beji Caid al-Sisi. Essebsi sorry. This is a big mistake. I&#8217;m sure your fridge has more than water, your excellency,&#8221; he told the Tunisian leader at a conference.He was referring to widely derided comments made by Sisi this week in which he claimed that his fridge only had water in it for a decade.Madani&#8217;s remark was &#8220;a serious encroachment against a founding member state of the organisation and its political leadership,&#8221; Egypt&#8217;s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said in a statement.&#8220;Such remarks do not conform with the responsibilities and the duties of the organisation&#8217;s secretary general position, and fundamentally affect his ability to carry out his duties,&#8221; he added in the statement in English.Madani, who has headed the 57-member bloc since 2014, has apologised, saying in a statement he meant no &#8220;insult to the Egyptian leadership&#8221;.-AFP
