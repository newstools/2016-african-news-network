Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez has underlined Diego Simeone&#8217;s towering influence at the club by promising he will not leave while the Argentine remains in charge.The 21-year-old has developed into one of Simeone&#8217;s most important players in the last two seasons, famously scoring a mesmeric winning goal against Bayern Munich last term.&#8220;As long as Simeone is here, no, I won&#8217;t leave,&#8221; Saul told Club del Deportista magazine.&#8220;When a coach has faith in you as much as he has and gives you that confidence, it&#8217;s vital.&#8221;Former Argentina midfielder Simeone has transformed Atletico&#8217;s fortunes since taking charge of the ailing club in 2011, breaking Barcelona and Real Madrid&#8217;s nine-year domestic stranglehold to win La Liga in 2014.They also won the Europa League (2012) and the King&#8217;s Cup (2013) and have also finished runner-up in two of the last three Champions League finals.Saul is far from the only Atletico player to speak of the coach&#8217;s influence, with France international Antoine Griezmann admitting in August he sought assurance Simeone would remain in charge before penning a new contract with the club.Yet Simeone&#8217;s iron grip on the club means Atletico could find themselves losing key personnel when he eventually decides to depart.The 46-year-old recently reduced his contract with Atletico from 2020 to 2018, casting doubt on his long-term future there.&#8220;For me and for Atletico it&#8217;s the same: Simeone is everything,&#8221; added Saul.&#8220;The tranquility he transmits to me has made me the player I am today on the pitch. It took a lot to win his confidence, but now I have it I have to keep fighting to the death for him.&#8221;-Reuters
