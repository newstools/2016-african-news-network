As the US presidential election moves into the home stretch, financial markets are not fully invested in polls that show a win for Hillary Clinton.Even though polls show the Democratic candidate with a strong lead over Republican Donald Trump, analysts say investors are waiting until after November 8 to lay their money on the table.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fully 100 percent Clinton is in,&#8221; said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, who sees a pullback in risk-oriented investments as a sign of investor caution.&#8220;Usually people are looking to take on extra risk for reward,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think this is one case where people are paring back on their risk.&#8221;Wall Street is thought to generally favor Clinton over Trump for president, and equity markets have hovered at historically high levels since July, with the S&amp;P 500 less than three percent below its all-time peak.Clinton is considered the more market-friendly outcome, expected to maintain the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, while the market views Trump as a great unknown, both because of his penchant for controversy and his lack of a record in public office.Trump has attacked trade partners China and Mexico and accused Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen of being a political tool of the Democratic party. Investors are also unsettled by Trump&#8217;s seeming embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a sign he may take foreign policy in radical new directions.Signs of nervousness have been seen in certain trades, analysts say, like the Mexican peso. Trump&#8217;s pledge of immigration controls and trade restrictions with Mexico have raised worries over its economy.The peso sank against the dollar as Trump&#8217;s campaign added momentum, but then rebounded on Clinton&#8217;s gains following the first presidential debate on September 26.But it remains down about 9 percent since Trump secured his party&#8217;s nomination in May.On the other hand, another gauge of market sentiment has been the biotechnology sector, which is seen as vulnerable in a Clinton presidency given the Democrat&#8217;s vow to address runaway drug prices. The Nasdaq biotechnology index has fallen about nine percent over the last month.Some analysts say the markets have already assumed a Clinton victory.&#8220;To me, the markets clearly want a Clinton win and they have priced that in,&#8221; said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management.&#8220;That&#8217;s what they predict, and that&#8217;s what they want. If that doesn&#8217;t happen, I feel there&#8217;s a great level of uncertainty and possible downside to the markets.&#8221;&#8211; Some &#8216;complacency&#8217; over Trump &#8211;Indeed, investors are aware that Trump has been consistently underestimated by the political, media and business establishment. Many are also loath to repeat the error of Britain&#8217;s June referendum to leave the European Union, when polling supported the market bet on a &#8220;stay&#8221; vote, only to be thrown into turmoil when Brexit passed.&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of complacency in the market.&#8221; said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management,&#8220;I think the market&#8217;s underestimating the possibility of things going wrong as a result of either a Trump victory or the possibility of internal strife in the nation as a result of Clinton winning,&#8221; she said.Briefing.com analyst Patrick O&#8217;Hare cited sluggish trading volume, as well as the flatness of the S&amp;P 500, as a sign investors are in &#8220;seeing is believing mode&#8221; with respect to polls pointing to a Clinton triumph.One sign of a pickup in caution is the VIX volatility index, also known as the &#8220;fear&#8221; index. The index has risen the last three days and jumped nearly 8 percent Thursday to 15.36. Still, that is far below the 25.76 level on the day after the Brexit shock.A big jump in the VIX before November 8 would signal &#8220;that the market is fearing something odd,&#8221; Kinahan said.AFP
