President Jacob Zuma is scheduled to take part in a question and answer session in the National Council of Provinces(NCOP) on Tuesday morning.Zuma is set to, amongst others, provide feedback on the progress made following suggestions to relocate Parliament from Cape Town to the nation&#8217;s Capital Pretoria.During his State of the Nation Address(SONA), Zuma said a lot of money would be saved if the country reconsidered the maintenance of two capitals.The ANC welcomed Zuma&#8217;s proposal with then Chief Whip Stone Sizani saying: &#8220;the existence of two capitals, Pretoria as the seat of government and Cape Town as the seat of Parliament, is an unsustainable, onerously expensive and indefensible arrangement which was intended to serve the narrow interests of the colonial rulers and must be corrected without delay.&#8221;Meanwhile, Zuma will also outline what he believes is the country&#8217;s economic position given the on going investigations into Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, when he delivers answers to the National Council Of Provinces (NCOP).NPA national director Shaun Abrahams announced that he would be prosecuting Gordhan on three counts of fraud amounting to R1.1m. Gordhan is expected to appear in court on November 2.The President will also be quizzed about the advantages of establishing the Presidential State Owned Enterprises Coordinating Council.Last month during the President&#8217;s question and answer session, Zuma was asked about the council, by Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane. Zuma said that this was not a duplication of the work carried out by a similar structure under the leadership of his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa. Let me reiterate that the inter-ministerial committee chaired by Deputy President Ramaphosa remains responsible for overseeing the stabilisation and reform of state-owned entities. The proposal to establish the Presidential SOCs Coordinating Council is aimed at assisting to ensure improved oversight and coordination of state owned companies, said Zuma.During his previous question and answer session, a defiant President Zuma threw down the gauntlet to Parliament asking not to be called if he wont be given space to answer questions. Zuma made his defiant stand after insults were thrown at him by some members of the opposition, including the DA, EFF and Cope.&#8211;Siphiwe Mchunu
