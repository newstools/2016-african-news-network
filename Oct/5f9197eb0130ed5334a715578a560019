Disgruntled Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members in KwaZulu-Natal, angered by the party s national leadership s decision to form a pact of sorts with the DA in key metros, such as Johannesburg and Tshwane, have ditched the organisation to form a rival party. Under the EFF national leadership, the party has deviated from the organisation s founding principles, former eThekwini EFF leader Mthandeni Zungu, who is leading the mass exodus, said. However, the straw that broke the camel s back was when they decided to work with the DA. It was a serious betrayal of the thousands that voted for the party on the basis of its revolutionary policies. The disgruntled members have resolved to form a rival party, the Effective Economic Emancipation (EEE), which they claim represents the EFF s founding principles. The party is home to all EFF members who were left homeless after EFF leaders such as the party s deputy president, Floyd Shivambu, hijacked the organisation and turned it into their own personal property, Zungu said.While the formation of the EEE is being spearheaded by former provincial EFF leaders, Zungu said, the new organisation had national appeal. In the next few days we will be holding meetings across all the provinces, calling on all EFF members to leave and join the EEE, he said.A few weeks ago, the EFF national leadership dissolved its KZN structure alongside that of the Eastern Cape. Frankly speaking there is no more EFF in KZN, that is why we are appealing to all people in the provinces who shared the EFF s founding values to join the EEE, Zungu said.Despite EFF leader Julius Malema criss-crossing KwaZulu-Natal to woo voters during the recent local government elections, the EFF struggled to garner support in the province, failing to secure a single ward in the eThekwini municipality controlled by the ANC. Each time we sent grievances to the national leadership we were simply ignored. We could not even plan properly for the elections as they wanted to control everything from the top, Zungu said.This is the second such upset for the EFF in the province.In 2014, disgruntled members left the party en masse to form rival party People s Revolutionary Movement (which contested the August local government elections.EFF members at the forefront of EEE, include eThekwini leader Nhlanhla Mthembu and Zanele Sangweni.EFF acting spokesperson Fana Mokoena was not available for comment.&#8211;Clive Ndou
