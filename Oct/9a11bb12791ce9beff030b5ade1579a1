With only a day to go before most Grade 12 pupils start with their final examinations, the class of 2016 is preparing for the start of the final chapter of their high school journey.Many matriculants are jittery about two of the first three papers this week, accounting and mathematics, which they say present the most challenges.Bonginkosi Makua, 17, said he had been focusing his energy on preparing for his accounting paper on Thursday. The only subject that threatens me at the moment is accounting but I have been working on it so I should be okay. We have been going through past exam papers to study and I think I am ready, he said.The pupil from Tsosoloso ya Afrika in Midrand said he and his friends had been studying at their school almost every night for the past few weeks, preparing for the exams. Makua said he was grateful for the support of his teachers who have been going the extra mile to ensure they were ready for these examinations.Aurelio Mokwatedi, 18, from Pro Arte in Pretoria said he was ready to bring his A-game to the examinations. Although he was confident, he said, he was worried that the two subjects he found challenging were scheduled to be written one after the other this week. I am quite confident that I will do well because I have been preparing for the examinations. I am hoping for the best. I am worried about accounting and maths as they are both this week, one after the other, but I am ready, he said.Mokwatedi said in preparation for the exams he tried to study about four or five topics that he was sure he was good at and take it from there.He said he ensured that he mastered the basics first and built up his studying from there. I spent about three of four days for every subject, ensuring I got the basics right. In the last few days, I have been getting in contact with the teachers, trying to get clarity on certain things, Mokwatedi said.Lillian Selapisasnn4@thenewage.co.za
