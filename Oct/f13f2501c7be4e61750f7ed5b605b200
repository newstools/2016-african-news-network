We find ourselves in difficult times, organiser Xoli Matomela said. The wounds of asking for free and decolonised education have cut deep and as have the response of violence and arrogance. We are, through song, dialogue and artistic exchange of ideas, uplifting our spirits again. That is the spirit driving the Free Education Live, a musical concert of healing.We will be fund-raising, dancing, singing and preparing ourselves to deal with the harsh inequalities of our society. The main objectives of the event are to garner public support, host a political school and fundraise for the sustainability of the movement. We hope that our objectives will be met in a space where we celebrate our blackness as we collectively seek to fight for our dignity and humanity, she said.The students call for free education has dominated newspaper headlines for the better part of the year. Talks between students and the government indicate that this is going to be an epic fight as both parties remain in a stalemate, with no end in sight. Students have in the process accused the government of refusing to genuinely find solutions that will bring about free and decolonised education .SIYABONGA SITHOLE |siyabongas@thenewage,co.za
