In a major boost for the manufacturing sector of KZN and the country and the fight against diseases such as cancer, Cipla BioTec and the Dube TradePort will build Africa s first fully integrated biopharmaceutical plant to make biopharmaceuticals within Dube TradePort Special Economic Zone in KwaZuluNatal.The parties previously announced the overall investment level for manufacturing and development costs to be about R1.3 bn. The two parties signed a memorandum of understanding for the commercial terms at a meeting in Goa, India on Friday.The facility will be South Africa s first biotech manufacturing facility for the production of biosimilars.The state of the art facility is set to produce a range of affordable treatments for cancer and other autoimmune diseases for the African and global market.MEC for economic development Sihle Zikalala hailed the deal, saying the investment represents the introduction of an entirely new technology into the South African economy which will have a wide reaching impact especially the elevation of the research and development done in tertiary education institutions. The nature of this investment is also socially important as it will provide lifesaving treatments for autoimmune diseases such as cancer, which are prohibitive for the majority of South African citizens. In our country, private medical aid schemes only fund healthcare services to about 16% of the population, where spending through those medical schemes is said to be at least six times higher than in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, he said.Zikalala also noted: The provision of affordable lifesaving medications to the majority of our economically active population will undoubtedly ease the burden on our society, ensuring that we have a healthier and highly productive population. Cipla BioTec aspires to transform the biosimilars market worldwide, by significantly increasing access with its strategy of one global product standard at affordable pricing. Cipla BioTec s unique manufacturing strategy is leveraged from its in house proprietary manufacturing software and single use technology.The biosimilars that will be produced at the new facility are anticipated to be used by the state and private health care centres. In addition to local consumption, the life-saving medication will also be exported to markets in Africa, US, European Union and Asia.These exports are expected to contribute to South Africa s economic growth.The construction of the new facility is scheduled to start in early 2017, with full operations expected to commence in the third quarter of 2018, where it is expected to generate at full capacity, some 300 jobs, with 180 of them being in the engineering and biological science fields, while a further 120 indirect jobs will be.NOKUTHULA NTULI
