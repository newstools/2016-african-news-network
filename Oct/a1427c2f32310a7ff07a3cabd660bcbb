Students at institutions of higher learning and matriculants have a month to apply for financial aid from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) for 2017.NSFAS Executive Officer Msulwa Daca briefed the media on Monday on the progress made with regards to the centralised 2017 applications and the activities, processes that they are engaged in around the new student-centred model.The scheme has called on all teachers and parents at home to remind the Grade 12 learners to submit their applications before the 30th of November 2016.Students who are receiving financial aid will also need to ensure their agreements as this will affect their 2017 registration as outstanding debt would need to be cleared by that time.Students are urged to sign their Loan Agreement Forums(LAF) and Schedules of Particulars(SOP) at their respective universities as soon as possible, cut off day is the end of November to allow NSFAS to process tuition payments.&#8220;We have noticed that there are students who have applied for NSFAS but have not signed their Loan Agreement Forums(LAF) and Schedules of Particulars(SOP) as yet,&#8221; said Daca.NSFAS announced that it has funded over 1.7 million students thus far, valued at R59bn with 480 000 students supported this year alone.In August, NSFAS opened the centralised applications which is aimed at improving access and providing affordable undergraduate education.NSFAS and Western Cape Education Department (WCED) went digital with its financial aid application system in August 1, targeting matriculants.The new online system will be able to verify beneficiaries information about their family income and whether the parents are deceased or alive.Over 190 000 students have managed to apply online. Daca assured students that they can still apply manually.Earlier this year, NSFAS stated that it was owed around R14bn by beneficiaries who completed their studies at TVET colleges and public universities, and has embarked on a campaign to encourage beneficiaries who are now employed, to inform them of their employment status and make arrangements to repay their loans.NSFAS is now included in the list of statutory bodies which can request South African Revenue Service (SARS) to furnish them with contact details of identified tax payers.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
