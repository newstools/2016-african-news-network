China s Feng Shanshan seized the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia lead as golfers finished the rain-interrupted third round on Sunday, but world number one Lydia Ko moved to within striking distance.Feng, the champion in 2014, had finished 17 holes on Saturday before play was called, and she parred the final hole Sunday morning for a third-round 64 marked by six birdies and an eagle.Feng then gained another stroke to move to 14-under overall early in the fourth round, with Sweden&#8217;s Anna Nordqvist and Norway&#8217;s Suzann Pettersen close on her heels at 13-under.The Korean duo of Jang Ha-Na and Amy Yang were another stroke behind.Ko also was in the hunt after managing to finish the third round on Saturday, carding a six-under-par 65 at the TPC Kuala Lumpur course.It was her best outing of the week and by early in the fourth round she had picked up three more shots to get to 11-under par, just three strokes off the lead.The New Zealand 19-year-old is looking for her first win since the Marathon Classic in July.That&#8217;s an uncharacteristic drought for the young phenom, who has struggled to break out on the leaderboard in Malaysia.She is using the services of a local Malaysian caddie this week after parting ways with her previous bagman Jason Hamilton earlier this month.-AFP
