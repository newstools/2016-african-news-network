Metrorail will set up a board of inquiry to investigate the horrific train crash in Tembisa yesterday.Key to the investigation will be to find out why the two passenger trains were travelling on the same line when they collided head on. One person was killed and more than 100 feared injured in the crash as paramedics battled to attend to the injured.ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics from ER24 along with numerous other services arrived on the scene and found that the two trains had collided.The accident took place at the rail split towards Oakmoor station in Tembisa from Kaalfontein.Some of the passengers had been flung out of the train and were scattered around the scene. On further inspection paramedics discovered a body lying trapped inside the wreckage. Unfortunately nothing more could be done and the patient was declared dead on the scene, he said. Paramedics treated the patients on scene and transported them to nearby facilities for further care. Emergency services are on the scene and will be for some time due to the number of patients. A 26-year-old man who was on his way to work, said he was lucky to have walked out with just minor injuries. The train from Tembisa went onto a wrong platform. We usually drive on the other side but today was different. We just had a blasting sound and part of the train fell down. I was able to hold on to something and jumped out as quick as I could he said.Kutullo Madishakutullom@thenewage.co.za
