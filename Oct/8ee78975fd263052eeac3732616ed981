The final tribute yesterday to late ANC veteran and lifetime activist Mewa Ramgobin was an emotional moment for the many activists whose lives he touched over the decades.Tribute after tribute reflected on Ramgobin s contribution to the struggle for freedom. Zweli Mkhize, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, provincial chair Sihle Zikalala, eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, Mac Maharaj, Vijay Ramlakan, Andries Nel, John Jeffery and a host of activists who span generations were influenced by Ramgobin.In addition to ANC national and provincial heavyweights, Natal Indian Congress, stalwarts including Thumba Pillay, Jerry Coovadia and Farouk Meer, who are instrumental in rallying support for Gordhan as he gears up to fight fraud charges, were also there.Gordhan disappointed those who may have expected him to touch on his current woes, choosing instead to focus on Ramgobin s contribution and the values he stood for. He had the unique ability to unite different groups across generations.We need to find the energy to carry his work forward, Gordhan said. Mewa would want us to be united despite our differences and or principles and despite our challenges, he said.Long term friend Paul David said: Mewa captured the free flow of ideas. Leader of the ANC s biggest region, eThekwini, Zandile Gumede called on activists to honour Mewa by being disciplined and stop publicly attacking each other if they do not agree on some matters. She urged ANC leaders to unite. Factions must never be elevated above the movement. Mewa was never a member of factions. He was a genuine member of the ANC and respected the party s Constitution, she said.-Nokuthula Ntuli
