As charlatans and counter-revolutionaries,&#8221; said the movement in a statement.FMF CPUT added that it has been peaceful and open to engagement from Day 1 of their student protests.&#8220;We want to ensure the Public and the university community that we are committed in resolving and diffusing the current impasse in the most responsible, respectful and peaceful manner possible with the aim of finding lost lasting solutions,&#8221; said FMF CPUT.The movement assured that they are not part of the thuggery adding that individuals are hijacking the #FeesMustFall peaceful campaign.Furthermore, they have vowed to work with the SAPS in ensuring that those responsible for violence and torching of their property are brought to book and punitive action is taken against them.FMF CPUT has condemn these acts of violence and arson as rogue acts, &#8220;we equally condemn the lack of leadership from the Vice-Chancellor that has created the space for opportunists to hijack their struggle.&#8221;The university management has opened a case of attempted murder after students allegedly locked some security guards in a burning building.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
