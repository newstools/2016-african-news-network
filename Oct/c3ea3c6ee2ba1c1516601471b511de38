PATRICIA Tshwaedi, a 41-year-old bus driver in QwaQwa for Maluti Bus Services (MBS), says the transport industry is transforming since she joined the industry about 10 years ago.Tshwaedi says the perception of people that woman cannot survive in the industry is slowly changing and it s no longer a taboo to see her behind the wheel of a bus. Driving buses here at Maluti Bus Services was not my first experience. I started my bus driving career at Big Sky couches in Bloemfontein before I joined MBS, Tshwaedi said.She said that despite joining the industry because of looking for employment, she took the opportunity to do away with the stereotype and the mentality that only man have the ability to drive buses. Initially I started in the industry working as a cashier when I joined Big Sky but the love of driving big engines developed and after realising that only few number of woman were drivers at the company, she said.Tshwaedi said being sure of what she was doing and nurturing the skill to drive helped her to gain confidence of the commuters who doubted her at first.She urged woman to continue occupying their rightful positions in any industry that is perceived to be for males only and take advantage of the gender employment equity policies that have been made possible by the government.-TEBOHO MOLOI
