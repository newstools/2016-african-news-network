Enterpreneurship is an important aspect of any developing economy because, aside from promoting innovation and stimulating economic growth, successful and established small businesses boost employment and elevate investor confidence.However, even as a developing nation, South Africa has a comparatively low rate of entrepreneurial activity. In fact, at a mere 9.2%, our country has 75% less entrepreneurial activity compared to other sub-Saharan African nations, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report 2015, although this was a 2.2% increase from 7% in 2014.Growing a successful small business takes talent, tenacity and support. Although the entrepreneurial journey is an exhilarating one, owning your own business is by no means an easy ride.South African SMEs face challenges such as tedious labour laws, onerous regulation requirements and shortage of skills. To be successful, entrepreneurs need as much backing as possible, and the banking sector should be an ardent supporter of SMEs.The greatest obstacle to entrepreneurial success is that entrepreneurs struggle to access funding. This growthinhibiting challenge is not unique to developing countries. The Global Competitiveness Report 2015-16 states that financing has been ranked the fourth most pressing concern for doing business in advanced economies (up from seventh place in 2007); in developing nations it is the number one worry, whereas in 2007 it only ranked fourth.Turning to SA, 27.6% of small businesses closed down in 2015 due to difficulties getting finance, a sobering 8.2% increase from the previous year. South Africa s banking sector is decidedly risk averse, which results in a difficult lending climate for small business owners needing to sustain and grow their ventures.Any benefits entrepreneurs may derive from our otherwise advanced and sophisticated banking system become irrelevant when financial institutions use unrealistic risk metrics to assess the potential of an SME.For example, SME owners do not always have three months worth of salary slips as proof of regular income, even though their cash flow may be stable. In addition, financial institutions demand big collateral as a prerequisite to providing funding for small businesses, yet entrepreneurs seldom possess multiple assets of significant value.As a result, small business owners often can t grow beyond self-funding efforts. Another barrier to success is the long approval time for loans. The realm of the entrepreneur is a fast-paced one, where opportunities can easily be lost if not capitalised on immediately.Being able to secure loans quickly and simply is vital for SME survival. In addition, entrepreneurs need immediate access to funds, and their cash flow must be constant so that they can sustain and grow their businesses. Flexibility is also key for entrepreneurs. Banks should take into consideration the fact that small businesses operate within a constantly changing environment and therefore a one-sizefits-all approach to loan repayment is, quite frankly, unrealistic.Entrepreneurs should see their bank as transparent and approachable and be able to build relationships with them. Financial institutions that are impersonal entities wielding big sticks will never be partners who understand the nuances of each small business, and this is what entrepreneurs need to thrive.If South Africa is to unlock its true monetary potential, then banks need to acknowledge that entrepreneurs are a key driver of the economy.It is imperative that banks re-evaluate their approval metrics when assessing small business loan eligibility so that more individuals start to view entrepreneurship as a financially viable economic activity.Environments that favour SMEs have proven to be important mechanisms for sustainable economic growth, as they encourage innovation, create jobs, promote development and stimulate wealth distribution.It is time for banks to step up to the plate and assist in creating a more conducive climate for small business prosperity.Sello Rabothata| sellor@thenewage.co.za
