Montenegro&#8217;s veteran leader Milo Djukanovic will not continue as prime minister in the next government according to his party, which topped recent parliamentary polls.The Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) late Tuesday said the party&#8217;s management had decided to propose Djukanovic&#8217;s deputy and former national security chief, Dusko Markovic, as candidate for premier.A party committee was expected to approve the decision later Wednesday.Djukanovic, who was set to remain party leader, has long dominated the small Balkan country, serving several times as premier and once as president since 1991.He has twice previously stepped down as prime minister but retained party leadership &#8212; once in 2006 and again in 2010 &#8212; both times returning to power after a two-year break.He has steered Montenegro towards closer ties with the West and to the doorstep of NATO and European Union membership, but his critics accuse him of corruption, cronyism and links to widespread organised crime.In October 16 elections, the DPS took 36 of the 81 seats in parliament, meaning coalition talks are necessary to form a government.The vote was marred by the arrests of 20 Serbians accused of planning anti-government attacks. Their detentions were dismissed by the opposition as DPS propaganda.-AFP
