THE first South African to develop a smartphone and tablet range will be a keynote speaker during the Success and Wealth Achievers Seminar in Bloemfontein next month.Thulani Khoza, who is the founder of tech firm Thules Telecoms and the TTouch range, studied IT at Wits University before furthering his studies in the UK and US. After completing my studies, I worked for the South African Broadcasting Service (SABC) and MTN South Africa before embarking on entrepreneurship route, Khoza said.He said he is presently a science and technology nominee for the SA Men of the Year Awards to be held in November 2016 and his journey has not been smooth sailing. As a young man growing up in Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, no one took me seriously. In fact, many people used to look down on me because of my poor circumstances but I told myself that one day I will become a respected somebody, Khoza said.He said while his line of smartphones and tablet came as a result of his love for technology, a lot of hard work and perseverance had to be part of the ingredients. Reaching this point has not been very easy at all, I have had more challenges that I have lost count but one thing I always told myself has been that this dream shall definitely come to fruition, Khoza said.Organisers of the Success and Wealth Achievers seminar said they were fortunate to have speakers of Khoza s calibre taking part in their event.One of the organisers Matefo Morakeng said among other things the aim of the seminar was to show people that their unfortunate circumstances should not cripple them but instead use the very circumstances to propel themselves to greater success. That is why it is such an honour to have people like him (Khoza) willing to share their story of how they made it despite their bleak backgrounds, Morakeng said.She said the event was also aimed at empowering people with information and critical skills in order to master the art of becoming successful and creating wealth for themselves.Another speaker expected is former Free State economic empowerment MEC Neo Masithela who is presently the CEO of Khora Investments and Property Investor.-BECKER SEMELA
