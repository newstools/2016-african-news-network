We were doing doggy style. It was a little bit too frantic. I think we overdid a little, indicated Horden.He was rushed to Medway hospital with his bloodied and bent private organ. A catheter was inserted into his penis and he was forced to have a circumcision.Horden&#8217;s girlfriend Kiera said she was in complete shock.&#8220;Steve was in a lot of pain. I was in shock, I never imagined something like this would happen. I felt a bit guilty as I think it was my thrusting backwards that was half the cause of it, said KieraSteven who hoped of becoming a father one day is now faced with fears of not being sure if that will eventually happen. The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can still have children, said Horden.&#8211;TNA Reporter
