An investigation has been launched into an arson attack at the University of Witwatersrand(Wits) after the Wartenweiler Library was set alight on Wednesday.The high-level investigation will be conducted by Wits Security and the police.&#8220;About 100 books were damaged and a high-level investigation is underway by Wits Security and the police,&#8221; said the institution.It is believed that the fire was started in the last aisle on the second floor of the library, and started with an accelerant or flammable substance which may have been hidden in a bag found on the scene.However, academic programmes continue on Thursday as per the academic calendar despite damage to the property.Meanwhile, students held a peaceful mass meeting at the Trinity Church on Wednesday after Fees Must Fall leader Mcebo Dlamini was denied bail.Wits SRC has called for an urgent review of the court&#8217;s decision and subsequently, bail to be granted immediately.The institution&#8217;s Vice-Chancellor Adam Habib made an appearance at the meeting but was requested to leave.Wits SRC said: &#8220;We requested Habib to leave the seating, simply because he and his team don&#8217;t care about the plight of the poor, only what public narrates about them.&#8221;Management is also scheduled to meet to decide on whether to keep the curfew or lift it.Students across universities are currently embarking on a march to the Union buildings to call for free education.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
