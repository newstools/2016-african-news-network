The discussion of South Africa withdrawing from the International Crimes Court (ICC) has been in the pipeline for quite some time.Many left-wing parties have criticised the ICC for being biased, with a driven right wing agenda that seeks to keep Africa enslaved by the west. The ICC came into conflict with the Africa Union (AU) when Sudanese president al-Bashir had to attend a meeting in South Africa last year. The government refused to arrest Bashir on the basis that he was considered an esteemed guest of the AU.This illustrates the direct conflict on agenda between the West and the anti-establishment.Herein is the crux of the matter, as stated by the Ministry of Justice, in exercising its international relations with foreign countries, particularly with countries in which serious conflicts occur or have occurred, South Africa is hindered by the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act, 2 (Act No 27 of 2002) . This act and the Rome Statute of the ICC compel South Africa to arrest persons who may enjoy diplomatic immunity under customary international law but who are wanted by the ICC for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and to surrender such persons to the ICC. South Africa has to do so, even under circumstances where we are actively involved in promoting peace, stability, and dialogue in those countries. The ministry said: The implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC Act, 2002, is in conflict and inconsistent with the provisions of the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act, 2001. South Africa has never seen eye to eye with Western imperial forces that attempt to force their agenda on the continent where they economically rape and pillage.When Western forces launched an attack against Gaddafi (a leader held in the highest regard by African leaders) they regarded him as a criminal to suit their agenda.To this day the South African government has defended the innocence of Gaddafi and, in my opinion, quite rightfully so. Similarly, the continual invasion of Iraq by the UK and the US, the plundering of land, mines and gold has been branded as acceptable by Western governments, and the ICC seemingly turns a blind eye to the blatantly obvious evidence of grand theft and drug trafficking occurring.The US and the UK are not only guilty of war crimes in Iraq and the Middle East, they have effectively brainwashed and manipulated the greater public into believing they were seeking so-called weapons of mass destruction , while actively having scavenger hunts through the many poppy fields, taking local spoils of war with no consequences whatsoever. Not to mention, the new leaked emails proving that presidential candidate Hilary Clinton sold weapons to Isis.It should be considered whether the narrative of Syria being peddled by the Western media has any accuracy at all. Many journalists returning from Syria, say the Western media has grossly lied about what s happening and Bashir is more innocent than assumed.Considering the recent statements from Russian President Vladmir Putin, in regard to the US s stance on Syria, it means African countries such as South Africa need to question the international narrative controlled by Western forces, as much as possible.Freedom can only be achieved when the government does not accept the status quo but is willing to challenge and question the narrative given, in order to protect the truth.While the UN and ICC continue to protect Israel despite its war crimes, South Africa courageously stood up in deciding to not be subjected to standing against what it believes is right. The international relations between African countries cannot be compared to the relations that the west has with African countries, and therefore, it should be measured and judged on its own merit, which seeks to liberate the people of Africa, as opposed to accepting the Western governments attempts to suppress the people of Africa, through biased agendas by biased organisations, such as the UN and ICC.It is not a question of diplomatic immunity, but a question of liberation, truth and justice in the face of agendas being driven to destabilise Africa.Chelsea LotzChelsea Lotz is a writer and commentator
