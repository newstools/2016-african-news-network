KGAUGELO Ya Sechaba Multi Purpose Community Centre, in partnership with department of social development, fed more than 250 people in Botshabelo this week to celebrate the International Day for the Eradication of poverty.The event, which was held at A section in the township, was to promote awareness to eradicate poverty worldwide.Centre manager Nyami Nkhumise said they were challenging the government to find more ways to fight hunger and poverty in communities. Our elderly, youth and children visiting clinics and hospitals collect their medication and wait in long queues with empty stomachs and still go back home with no food to eat.This is a call to action with interfaith organisations and all members of the community to fight this problem that is affecting many families, Nkhumise said.She thanked the good work and the support by the social development in making the event successful, and the fact that communities were provided with the tips to grow backyard gardens and their own nutritious food.Elsewhere, Recross, the health department, Newstart, Nova, Mosamaria and the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) embarked on a campaign in Khayelisha informal settlement, Bloemfontein, this week where more than 178 residents were tested for various diseases including HIV and Aids.Some were assisted with their monthly grants and Nova, which deals with men who have sexual relations with other men, advised on how to have safe sex.Claudia Mangwegape of Red Cross said the purpose of the outreach programme was to ensure that many people are tested, and helped them know their status and to be encouraged to take treatment where necessary. Many people do not want to go to the clinics because there are long queues, so the programme is to help them to know their status. The outreach was successful and we will continue to promote in various parts of the province, Mangoegape said.-BECKER SEMELA
