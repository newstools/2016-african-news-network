Witwatersrand University(Wits) SRC on Wednesday vowed that the struggle for free education will continue despite Fees Must Fall student leader Mcebo Dlamini being denied bail.A mass meeting is scheduled to take place at the Trinity Church following the court&#8217;s decision to remand Dlamini in custody.Wits SRC said it is adamant that due to Dlamini&#8217;s bail denial, the decision will encourage the movement to continue even more.Dlamini was denied bail in the Johannesburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Wednesday.Magistrate Albertus Roux said: &#8220;It would not be in the interest of justice to release the applicant on bail.&#8221;Dlamini&#8217;s case has been postponed to 15 November 2016 for trial at the Johannesburg High Court. He will appear in court on November 10 to conclude investigation.The Magistrate further labelled Dlamini as &#8216;dishonest&#8217; because he was told he was not honest with the court.Roux said: &#8220;the evidence in his affidavit is not convincing. The applicant was not always friendly and honest with the court.&#8221;Wits workers don&#39;t want to leave court without Mcebo. pic.twitter.com/uk3itA4OtW&mdash; Wits SRC (@WitsSRC) October 19, 2016Students are outraged by the court decision to deny Dlamini bail and have expressed disappointment.
