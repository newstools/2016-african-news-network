THE newly elected Nketoane local municipality mayor Mamiki Mokoena said she had prioritised economic growth for job creation and the establishment of banks in the area.Mokoena was responding to an outcry by residents of Mamafubedu Petrus-Steyn for not having banks in the area, which forces them to travel long distances to surrounding towns to access some of the essential services.Mokoena said it was important that they grew the economy of the municipality to create jobs for residents and were already in talks with farmers in the area including VKB AgricultureEnterprise for more job opportunities for the local residents. It will be easy for banks to open branches here for our people once the economy in the area is doing well, Mokoena said.Residents of Mamafubedu said they were forced to keep their money in their homes even though it was not a good idea, but they had no choice.-TEBOHO MOLOI
