Political parties have indicated plans to forge ahead with a planned march in the nation&#8217;s capital on Wednesday where they will be calling for National Director of Public Prosecutions(NDPP) Shaun Abrahams to step down.The move follows an announcement by Abrahams on Monday to drop fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula.Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) which initially declared that it would be marching in support of Gordhan, has indicated the march will go ahead as previously planned.Just In: Letter by #ShaunAbrahams confirms #NPA has withdrawn fraud charges against Gordhan, Magashula and Pillay. pic.twitter.com/ZlVX16V9KJ The_New_Age (@The_New_Age) October 31, 2016We are going ahead with our protest on the 02 Nov to demand #shaunabrahams to resign &amp; #ZumaMustFall.Let&#8217;s meet @ church square in Pretoria Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) October 31, 2016The EFF has also submitted a request to the General Council of the Bar for the disbarment of Adv Shaun Abrahams and his removal from the roll of advocates.Speaking during a briefing on Monday where he announced the decision to drop charges, Abrahams stated that he would not be stepping down.#NPA Abrahams: Will I resign? &#8220;Certainly not, certainly not.&#8221; @ANN7tv Kalden O Lachungpa (@KaldenOngmu) October 31, 2016Meanwhile Democratic Alliance(DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called on President Zuma to suspend Abrahams with immediate effect and hold a parliamentary inquiry into his fitness to hold office.&#8220;Today s decision by&#8230;Shaun Abrahams, to drop criminal charges against Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, vindicates the DA s position that these charges were indeed manufactured for malicious political purposes, and were without merit from their inception,&#8221; said Maimane&#8220;Shaun Abrahams must be held responsible for this unacceptable blunder&#8230;I therefore call on President Zuma to suspend Shaun Abrahams with immediate effect. In terms of section 12(6) of the NPA Act, the President can provisionally suspend the NDPP from his office, pending such inquiry into his office as the President may deem fit,&#8221; continued Maimane.The African National Congress(ANC) said it welcomed Abrahams&#8217; decision to drop charges against the trio adding that it had always believed Gordhan to be innocent.&#8220;The ANC always believed in the innocence of Comrade Pravin Gordhan, hence our unwavering support since fraud charges were preferred against him,&#8221; said party spokesperson Zizi Kodwa.&#8220;Actions of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to charge Comrade Pravin Gordhan and others, have had a negative impact on the economy and created unnecessary speculations about the real motive,&#8221; continued Kodwa.The ANC also called for such a mistake to never be repeated by the NPA.&#8220;The ANC calls on the appointing authority to engage the NPA leadership to avoid a repeat of this and to protect the independence and integrity of the NPA,&#8221; Kodwa said.Congress of the People (COPE) spokesperson Dennis Bloem also took Abrahams to task saying he was &#8216;remote controlled&#8217; and Pravin Gordhan and his co-accused never had a case to answer to.&#8220;We know from the onset there was no case against the three. I am more than ever convinced that this was a political motivated case. Anyone can see that this was politically motivated,&#8221; said Bloem.He also called for Abrahams to step down saying &#8220;this is a huge embarrassment for Shaun Abrahams and he has brought this institution into disrepute.&#8221;The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) has also called on Abrahams to resign a call echoed by the Pan African Congress which added that it would be joining the planned march to call for the resignation of Abrahams.#NPA a huge blunder and political prosecution.Shaun Abrahams should resign.A good leader would never duck responsibility . ACDP South Africa (@A_C_D_P) October 31, 2016#shaunabrahams should resign with immediate effect. He is indeed a tool used to advance political interests. He is a disgrace to the nation.
