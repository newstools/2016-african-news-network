At least 500 community members gathered at the Ivory Park North Hall on Wednesday to witness 38 households receiving long awaited title deeds.Mayor Herman Mashaba said he is deeply humbled to be able to provide residents of Ivory Park with the dignity of owning their own homes. It was a day of celebration for the community of Ivory Park and it was an honour to be able to share this moment of joy with them. Having title to your home is more than just possessing a piece of paper. It provides residents with an asset which they can pass on to their children and grandchildren, said Mashaba.The Department of Housing is currently in the process of allocating more than 2000 title deeds to residents of Johannesburg. These are title deeds that will be provided to residents without any conditions of political support.Mayor Mashaba indicated that the new administration has an enormous task ahead as they work tirelessly to deliver better services to residents, especially the poor.Mashaba said Ivory Park is a community that suffers from high unemployment, poverty and a lack of basic services.The Mayor called on all the residents to unite behind the DA&#8217;s vision in Johannesburg, a vision that aims at job creation, delivering better services and stopping corruption.Last week, Mayor Mashaba was expected to hand over title deed in Ward 53 Lufhereng but he was confronted with drama when ANC supporters accused Mashaba of hijacking a local housing project.Mashaba together with community development mayoral committee member Nonhlanhla Sifumba were forced to leave after handing over only four houses and could not hand over title deeds at all. Nobody is hijacking anything here, the mayor is just delivering service. So the only people that we can say that they are hijacking are those people who rented the crowd that was there trying to disrupt the work of the city, Sifumba said.-Simangele Legodi
