Little known Dutch-born South African striker Lars Verswijk has been selected by Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba for the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Senegal on November 12 at the Peter Mokhaba Stadium in Polokwane.Verswijk plays for Belgian side KV Kortrijk and has had previous stints at English side Nottingham Forrest and Dutch sides FC Utrecht and PEC Zwolle.Mashaba has recalled goalkeeper Ronwen Williams, defender Asavela Mbekile, midfielders May Mahlangu and Daine Klate, as well as forwards Thuso Phala and Bradley Grobler. &#8220;We went to Burkina Faso and came back with a point &#8211; even though I feel we could have won it but now that we are playing at home, no other result than a win will do. The most important way to keep your chances alive in the qualifiers is to win all your home games; you do that, half way the job is done,&#8221;Mashaba said.Mashaba mentioned how Mamelodi Sundowns should be used as an example of how important it is to gather points at home. The coach said that a loss could set the team back as they strive to qualify for the World Cup after participating in 2010 when it was hosted on home soil.&#8220;A win is very crucial because it will see us at the top of the group this early and everything will be in our hands going forward. The challenge with losing points is that you play catch up, which puts you under a lot of pressure and before you know it, the qualifiers are finished.&#8220;So it is important that we wrestle the leadership now so that we are in a commanding place going into the halfway stage next year,&#8221; the former under 23 coach said.Bafana face a Senegalese team that beat Cape Verde 2-0 in the qualifiers and the dangerous in form Liverpool player Sadio Mane will be giving both coach Shakes Mashaba and his defenders something to think about during the preparations leading up to the game.GOALKEEPERS:Ronwen WILLIAMS:Supersport United FC ;Itumeleng KHUNE:Kaizer Chief FC ;Brighton MHLONGO: Orlando Pirates FC DEFENDERS:Ramahlwe MPHAHLELE:Kaizer Chiefs FC ;Rivaldo COETZEE:Ajax Cape Town FC; Thulani HLATSHWAYO:Bidvest Wits; FC Clayton DANIELS:Supersport United FC;Asavela MBEKILE: Mamelodi Sundowns FC:Tebogo LANGERMAN:Mamelodi Sundowns FC; Eric MATHOHO:Kaizer Chiefs FC;Thabo MATLABA:Orlando Pirates FC MIDFIELDERS:Dean FURMAN:Supersport United FC;Andle JALI:KV Oostende FC;MAY MAHLANGU:Dinamo Bucaresti FC;Ayanda PATOSI:Lokeren FC (Belgium);Keagan DOLLY:Mamelodi Sundowns FC; Daine KLATE:Bidvest Wits FC;Mpho MAKOLA:Orlando Pirates FC;Hlompho KEKANA:Mamelodi Sundowns FC;STRIKERS:Eleazar RODGERS:Bidvest Wits FC;Bradley GROBLER:Supersport United FC;Lars VELDWIJK:KV Kortrjk (Belgium);Sibusiso VILAKAZI:Mamelodi Sundowns FC;Thulani SERERO:Ajax Amsterdam (Holland);Thuso PHALA:Supersport United FC;-Lehlogonolo Mashigo
