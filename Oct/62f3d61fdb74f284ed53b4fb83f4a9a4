Four women leaders from the Durban Port are finalists in the Women in Transport Awards which will take place tonight at the Durban International Convention Centre.The Women in Transport Awards, which are co-located with the African Ports Evolution and African Rail Evolution conference 2016, honours those who have achieved excellence in the rail and maritime industries in Africa.Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) Durban-based officials Silindile Mkhabela, Nandipha Mtsokoba, Sylvia Siyo and captain Pinky Zungu have been nominated in the best head of department in transport category. The maritime sector used to be one that was closed off to the historically disadvantaged, including women, with only 2% of women globally estimated to be involved in the shipping industry. TNPA has solid strategies in place to attract and develop women in the industry and these finalists are testament to the success of many of our programmes, Durban Port manager Moshe Motlohi said.TNPA is also in the running for best port operator or terminal in Africa award, alongside the Namibian Port Authority, Port of Maputo in Mozambique, Port of Tema in Ghana and DSM Corridor Group ofDar es Salaam in Tanzania. The awards are segmented into five categories to cater for female contribution across the broad spectrum of the transport industry, awards director Athi Myoli said.She said the number of nominations received from across Africa was overwhelming and the positive response was testimony to the many successes in the industry that need the recognition that they so rightfully deserve.Her sentiments were shared by head of shipper s services at Ghana Shippers Authority, Naa Densua Aryeetey, who said: It is indeed a worthy event to recognise women who have contributed immensely one way or another to the development of African maritime and the rail industry, Aryeetey said.The African Ports Evolution Forum forms part of a week-long series of activities dedicated to the African transport sector, attracting over 1000 participants from more than 15 countries and incorporates a trade expo, the African Rail Evolution Forum, the Women in Transport Awards and Kwazulu-Natal Export Week.The two-day event brings together port operators and industry experts from across Africa to learn, network and discuss best practices on how to improve port infrastructure and competitiveness, connectivity with rail networks and logistical performance.Increasing port competitiveness through improved customer-focused needs is a key driver of most ports in Africa and Aruna Bunwaree Ramsaha, deputy DG of the Mauritius Port Authority, will be speaking at the forum on how the Port Louis Harbour has been improving port infrastructure with the goal of enhancing customer experience.NOKUTHULA NTULI
