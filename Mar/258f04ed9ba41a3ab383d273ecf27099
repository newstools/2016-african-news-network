A 13-year-old boy and 7-year-old girl were killed on Wednesday morning after a light motor vehicle and a bakkie collided on the N12, about 5kms outside of Witbank, Mpumalanga.The light motor vehicle and bakkie were found lying on one side of the road blocking the traffic. The entire back section of the light motor vehicle had been completely smashed.ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said: On inspection, paramedics found the lifeless bodies of two children lying inside the light motor vehicle. The boy was found lying trapped in the rear of the vehicle while the girl was found in the front passenger seat. The young boy was declared dead on the scene after succumbing to multiple injuries. The young girl was extricated from the vehicle and found to be in a critical condition.Paramedics began treatment and advanced life support interventions but no vital signs returned and she was declared dead.Both male drivers were found to have sustained only minor injuries. They were treated and thereafter transported to a hospital in Witbank for further treatment. It is believed that the driver of the light motor vehicle swerved to avoid a tyre in the middle of the road. He apparently lost control of the vehicle, slid across the centre medium and collided with the bakkie in oncoming traffic, Meiring said.-TNA Reporter
