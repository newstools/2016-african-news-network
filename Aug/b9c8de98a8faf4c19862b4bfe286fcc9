The department of human settlements vowed to root out the corruption of allocating RDP houses to people who did not appear on the list of legitimate beneficiaries in the entire province.The assurance was made by the newly appointed human settlements MEC Speedy Mashilo when he was addressing the department s senior managers in Mbombela.Mashilo said the provincial government was concerned about the number of such shelters which were illegally allocated to undeserving people, including the youth, while the impoverished were neglected.He said the unlawful occupation of RDP houses was hindering the government from speeding up the provision of viable services and such behaviour would not be tolerated.Mashilo said: Human settlement is key in service delivery. An illegal allocation of government low cost houses to people who do not deserve them should be checked thoroughly to bring that to an end.Houses have been built but given to the wrong beneficiaries. Such negligence cannot be tolerated. I am entrusted with the responsibility of delivering these houses to local municipalities. Therefore, we need to keep close working relations with local municipalities. He said the department was worried about houses and other related projects being built by unskilled contractors because such projects were not durable and were tarnishing the ANC-led government s image. I need to know all those contractors who do not have the capacity to deliver. We do not develop contractors, we deliver houses and infrastructure to our people, Mashilo said.He is among the three new MECs appointed by Premier David Mabuza following his cabinet reshuffle last week. He succeeded MEC Violet Siwela who is also the ANC deputy chairperson after being deployed to deputy speaker in the legislature.Before being deployed in the human settlements portfolio, Mashilo was sworn in as a member in the provincial legislature for a few months. Mashilo is serving his second term as the chairperson of the ANC in the Nkangala district as well.He is the former long-serving executive mayor of the Nkangala district municipality.France Nyaka
