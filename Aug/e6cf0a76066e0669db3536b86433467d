The provincial department of finance, economic development and tourism, received its first clean audit report from the auditor general for its outstanding performance in the 2015- 16 financial year.Finance, economic development and tourism MEC Eric Kholwane, said the achievement was simply an indication that the department had improved in managing its financial affairs and ensuring better provision of services.Kholwane said the achievement occurred because of the tireless work contributed to the department by the former department heads, Thulani Mdakane and Jacob Mgidi.He said the department managed to receive its first-ever clean audit outcome as declared by the country s auditor-general after scrutinising its performance and financial statements for the previous financial year.Kholwane said: I am delighted that we are surely on the right track of ensuring that all departments and public entities in the province received clean audit outcomes which one can equate to a clean bill of health. The department followed on the pioneering footsteps of one of our public entities the Mpumalanga Gambling Board, which has since its inception, received clean audit outcomes and the provincial treasury. We congratulate the team at the department for this achievement which should be maintained without failure. Kholwane is among the four MECs who survived from the axe wielded by Premier David Mabuza a few days ago when he brought in three new MECs in a bid to reinforce service delivery in their deployed respective portfolios.France Nyaka
