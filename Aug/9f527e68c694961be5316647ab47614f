Thousands of pupils in Vuwani area in Vhembe district are not writing trial examinations like their peers in the province because they are not yet ready. Pupils in Vuwani whose education was badly affected by municipal borderrelated community protests during the year will only sit for their trial examinations on Thursday. They are on catch up programmes and will be able to sit for trial examinations this week. Trial examinations in the rest of the province are presently under way, provincial education department spokesperson, Dr Naledzani Rasila said yesterday.School attendance in Vuwani has been disrupted since May 1 after the community lost a high court bid to reverse the decision by the municipal demarcation board to incorporate the area into the new municipality which includes Malamulele.During the violent protests, 30 schools were burnt down allegedly by community members who demanded that Vuwani be reincorporated into Makhado municipality in Louis Trichardt.As violent protests raged on, pupils and teachers stayed away from schools until the second week of this month after a peace agreement facilitated by the inter-ministerial task team was reached with stakeholders.The situation on the education front has since returned to normality and 2000 Grade 12 pupils who were put in special camps in Seshego, Nkowankowa and Nzhelele returned to their schools in Vuwani early this month.The total amount required for emergency reconstruction and rehabilitation of educational infrastructure in Vuwani amounts to R303.1m, said provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba. A total of 76 mobile classrooms at the cost of R22m for Vuwani and surrounding villages have been delivered, Seloba said.-Montsho Matlala
