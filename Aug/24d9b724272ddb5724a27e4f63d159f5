The new agriculture, rural development, land and environmental affairs MEC, Vusi Shongwe praised Premier David Mabuza for deploying him in the challenging portfolio.Shongwe was moved from the community safety, security and liaison portfolio when Mabuza introduced three new MECs as part of his legislature reshuffling three weeks ago.Among the new cabinet members is Pat Ngomane who took over the reins from Shongwe. Shongwe voiced his happiness about serving in the new department when he was addressing his staff in Mbombela.The politician, who is also serving as the provincial treasurer of the ANC, said he was indeed satisfied about the relationship between him and Mabuza as a result of the vast experience he had in the government sector.He also once served as the MEC responsible for culture, sport and recreation department. I am grateful to Premier David Mabuza for having confidence in me in leading a big department like this with nine programmes that are also touching the lives of the people. That is what I like the most working on the ground as that is what I have done before, Shongwe said. He said entering into a memorandum of understanding with the University of Mpumalanga to see young people being trained in the field of agriculture was among his plans, which are in line with the vision of the department. I will also partake in visiting projects to assess the impact that has been made and which is why I will no longer use fancy cars. I opted for a double cab bakkie that will necessitate me to access the projects, Shongwe said.He even urged his new staff to work hard to bring satisfaction to the beneficiaries. I am encouraging the staff to move with speed when it comes to service delivery and the staff should be mindful that the people we serve must have confidence in this department, Shongwe said.-France Nyaka
