THE newly constructed De Aar Hospital is due to be opened later this year, spokesperson for the provincial department of health, Lebohang Mahaja said.Mahaja said MEC for health Lebohang Mothlaping would officially open the hospital which has already been been handed over by the provincial department of public works. The department is excited that the project to complete this state-of the-art hospital has been finalised. We are pleased that the construction journey that began nearly six years ago, coming to an end, Mahaja said.The department of health said they would implement a three-year phase that would allow the hospital to be fully operational in all its aspects . While the major construction aspects of the work have been completed, we need to tighten loose ends. He said the current health services offered at the hospital would be moved to the new facility , and that old hospital was not big enough to accommodate a high volume of patients.Mahaja said the hospital, which was first commissioned in 2010 would, when complete, rate as one of the largest in the country. Public works official Crystal Robertson said the department was happy about the building project which had created many job opportunities for the local residents. We are happy that job opportunities were created for the local community. While the hospital will provide health services for the local people, the project has in addition provided job opportunities for the residents, Robertson said.He said the hospital would provide specialisation in gynaecology and surgery, among others and that the residents were happy that they would not have to travel long distances to specialist hospitals to acquire these services.The province is expanding its infrastructure which includes the extension project to the Sol Plaatje University to accommodate additional numbers. The university accommodates 700 students and the expansion, when complete, will allow several hundreds more students to enrol. The youth in the province don t have to go far for tertiary education as this will be provided locally, he said.The university opened its doors in 2014.&#8211;DIKELEDI RAMABOPA
